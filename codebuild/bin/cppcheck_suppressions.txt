// cppcheck Message: (style:redundantAssignment) Variable 'mock_time' is reassigned a value before the old one has been used.
// Reason: s2n_config_set_monotonic_clock() takes a reference to mock_time so that whenever it's modified locally, the timer sees the update when it dereferences the pointer.

// cppcheck Message: (style:knownConditionTrueFalse) Condition 's2n_libcrypto_awslc_api_version()<17' is always true
// Reason: s2n_libcrypto_awslc_api_version() are implemented using macro's and for certain libcrypto's the preprocessor will produce a trivial function returning e.g. 1 always.
