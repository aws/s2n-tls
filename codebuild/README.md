### CodeBuild script info

#### Design

- How does CodeBuild decide what to install/test ?
   To match with Travis and minimize rewriting, the environment variables passed to the job
   dictate what is installed and which tests get run.
- Why not build docker images with the dependencies layered in ?
  This is the end goal: get tests running in CodeBuild first, then optimize the containers where it makes sense.

### Usage to setup Projects

Using your favorite virtualenv, install the following dependencies:
```
pip install boto3
pip install awacs
pip install troposphere
```

To bootstrap the CodeBuild jobs, the python script:
```
# Verify your config is correct
./create_project.py --config the-config-file.config

# If this is a new stack, commit the changes
./create_project.py --config the-config-file.config --production

# If the stack already exists, then use a change set for the existing stack
./create_project.py --config the-config-file.config --production --modify-existing
```

If you are modifying an existing stack then a list of changes will be displayed and
you have the option to accept or reject those changes.

```

- Use CloudFormation to create the stack with the generated template.
- Open the CodeBuild projects in the console and setup the Source correctly, using your OTP credentials to connect to Github

### Words about CodeBuild instance size and concurrency

The [AWS Codebuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/limits.html) docs list the number of concurrent jobs at 60.
With extensive testing, we've learned this number appears to be weighted based on [instance size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html) (or provisioning limits), so running all tests on the largest possible instances will reduce actual concurrency.  Additionally provisioning time is currently longer for larger instances, so there is a time penalty that might not be recovered by using a larger instance for short lived tests.

### Notes on moving from Travis-ci

- Install_clang from Travis is using google chromium clang commit from 2017- which requires python2.7 (EOL); updated for CodeBuild.
- CodeBuild's environment is more restrictive than Travis- these jobs require elevated privilege to function.
- Warning message from the fuzzer about test speed appear in CodeBuild output, but not in Travis-CI with the same test (See comments on AWS forums about a difference in ANSI TERM support); this also affects colorized output.
- macOS/OSX platform files were not copied because CodeBuild does not support macOS builds.


### Querying CodeBuild projects

Here is a sample of how to double check the size of the build hosts, as an example.  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY for an associated AWS account will need to be set for this to work, as well as a file called jobs, listing the names of all the CodeBuild jobs you'd like to check.


```
for i in $(cat jobs); do echo -e "$i\t";aws codebuild batch-get-projects --name "$i" |jq '.projects[].environment.computeType'; done
```
