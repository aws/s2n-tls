# This buildspec runs on an Ubuntu22 image. That configuration is a property of
# the codebuild job itself.

# Codebuild's matrix jobs have non-differentiated names so use batch-list
# instead.

# Parameter motivation

# LIBCRYPTOS
# awslc: happy path libcrypto for s2n-tls
# openssl 3: s2n-tls takes different code paths for ossl3, so make sure we run 
#            asan on it. See pr 4033 for a historical motivating example.
