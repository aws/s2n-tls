# ### Cipher hash:
# A 12 character truncated sha256 hash of the list of ciphers sorted in hex order, first 12 characters. The list is created using the 4 character hex values of the ciphers, lower case, comma delimited, ignoring GREASE.  
# Example:
# ```
# 1301,1302,1303,c02b,c02f,c02c,c030,cca9,cca8,c013,c014,009c,009d,002f,0035
# ```
# Is sorted to:
# ```
# 002f,0035,009c,009d,1301,1302,1303,c013,c014,c02b,c02c,c02f,c030,cca8,cca9 = 8daaf6152771
# ```
#
# If there are no ciphers in the sorted cipher list, then the value of JA4_b is set to `000000000000`
# We do this rather than running a sha256 hash of nothing as this makes it clear to the user when a field has no values.
