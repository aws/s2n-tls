# ### JA4 Algorithm:
#
# (QUIC=”q”, DTLS="d", or Normal TLS=”t”)
# (2 character TLS version)  
# (SNI=”d” or no SNI=”i”)  
# (2 character count of ciphers)  
# (2 character count of extensions)  
# (first and last characters of first ALPN extension value)  
# _  
# (sha256 hash of the list of cipher hex codes sorted in hex order, truncated to 12 characters)  
# _  
# (sha256 hash of (the list of extension hex codes sorted in hex order)_(the list of signature algorithms), truncated to 12 characters)  
#   
# The end result is a fingerprint that looks like:  
# t13d1516h2_8daaf6152771_b186095e22b6
