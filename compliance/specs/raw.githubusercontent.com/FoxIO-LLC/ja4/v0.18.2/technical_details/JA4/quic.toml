# ### QUIC:
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC  
# “q” or “t”, which denotes whether the hello packet is for QUIC or TCP. QUIC is the protocol which the new HTTP/3 standard utilizes, encapsulating TLS 1.3 into UDP packets. As QUIC was developed by Google, if an organization heavily utilizes Google products, QUIC could make up half of their network traffic, so this is important to capture.  
# 
# If the protocol is QUIC then the first character of the fingerprint is “q” if not, it’s “t”.
