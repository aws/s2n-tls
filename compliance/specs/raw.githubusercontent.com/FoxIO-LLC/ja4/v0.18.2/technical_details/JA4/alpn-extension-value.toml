# ### ALPN Extension Value:
#
# The first and last characters of the ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) first value.  
# List of possible ALPN Values (scroll down): https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml
# 
# 
# 
# In the above example, the first ALPN value is h2 so the first and last characters to use in the fingerprint are “h2”. IF the first ALPN listed was http/1.1 then the first and last characters to use in the fingerprint would be “h1”.
# 
# In Wireshark this field is located under tls.handshake.extensions_alpn_str
# 
# If there are no ALPN values or no ALPN extension then we print “00” as the value in the fingerprint.
