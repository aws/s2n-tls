# ### TLS Version:
#
# TLS version is shown in 3 different places. If extension 0x002b exists (supported_versions), then the version is the highest value in the extension. Remember to ignore GREASE values. If the extension doesn’t exist, then the TLS version is the value of the Protocol Version. Handshake version (located at the top of the packet) should be ignored.
# 
# 0x0304 = TLS 1.3 = “13”  
# 0x0303 = TLS 1.2 = “12”  
# 0x0302 = TLS 1.1 = “11”  
# 0x0301 = TLS 1.0 = “10”  
# 0x0300 = SSL 3.0 = “s3”  
# 0x0200 = SSL 2.0 = “s2”  
# 0x0100 = SSL 1.0 = “s1”
