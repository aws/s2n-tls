# 6.2.  Error Alerts
#
# Error handling in TLS is very simple.  When an error is detected, the
# detecting party sends a message to its peer.  Upon transmission or
# receipt of a fatal alert message, both parties MUST immediately close
# the connection.
# 
# Whenever an implementation encounters a fatal error condition, it
# SHOULD send an appropriate fatal alert and MUST close the connection
# without sending or receiving any additional data.  In the rest of
# this specification, when the phrases "terminate the connection" and
# "abort the handshake" are used without a specific alert it means that
# the implementation SHOULD send the alert indicated by the
# descriptions below.  The phrases "terminate the connection with an X
# alert" and "abort the handshake with an X alert" mean that the
# implementation MUST send alert X if it sends any alert.  All alerts
# defined below in this section, as well as all unknown alerts, are
# universally considered fatal as of TLS 1.3 (see Section 6).  The
# implementation SHOULD provide a way to facilitate logging the sending
# and receiving of alerts.
# 
# The following error alerts are defined:
# 
# unexpected_message:  An inappropriate message (e.g., the wrong
#    handshake message, premature Application Data, etc.) was received.
#    This alert should never be observed in communication between
#    proper implementations.
# 
# bad_record_mac:  This alert is returned if a record is received which
#    cannot be deprotected.  Because AEAD algorithms combine decryption
#    and verification, and also to avoid side-channel attacks, this
#    alert is used for all deprotection failures.  This alert should
#    never be observed in communication between proper implementations,
#    except when messages were corrupted in the network.
# 
# record_overflow:  A TLSCiphertext record was received that had a
#    length more than 2^14 + 256 bytes, or a record decrypted to a
#    TLSPlaintext record with more than 2^14 bytes (or some other
#    negotiated limit).  This alert should never be observed in
#    communication between proper implementations, except when messages
#    were corrupted in the network.
# 
# handshake_failure:  Receipt of a "handshake_failure" alert message
#    indicates that the sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable
#    set of security parameters given the options available.
# 
# bad_certificate:  A certificate was corrupt, contained signatures
#    that did not verify correctly, etc.
# 
# unsupported_certificate:  A certificate was of an unsupported type.
# 
# certificate_revoked:  A certificate was revoked by its signer.
# 
# certificate_expired:  A certificate has expired or is not currently
#    valid.
# 
# certificate_unknown:  Some other (unspecified) issue arose in
#    processing the certificate, rendering it unacceptable.
# 
# illegal_parameter:  A field in the handshake was incorrect or
#    inconsistent with other fields.  This alert is used for errors
#    which conform to the formal protocol syntax but are otherwise
#    incorrect.
# 
# unknown_ca:  A valid certificate chain or partial chain was received,
#    but the certificate was not accepted because the CA certificate
#    could not be located or could not be matched with a known trust
#    anchor.
# 
# access_denied:  A valid certificate or PSK was received, but when
#    access control was applied, the sender decided not to proceed with
#    negotiation.
# 
# decode_error:  A message could not be decoded because some field was
#    out of the specified range or the length of the message was
#    incorrect.  This alert is used for errors where the message does
#    not conform to the formal protocol syntax.  This alert should
#    never be observed in communication between proper implementations,
#    except when messages were corrupted in the network.
# 
# decrypt_error:  A handshake (not record layer) cryptographic
#    operation failed, including being unable to correctly verify a
#    signature or validate a Finished message or a PSK binder.
# 
# protocol_version:  The protocol version the peer has attempted to
#    negotiate is recognized but not supported (see Appendix D).
# 
# insufficient_security:  Returned instead of "handshake_failure" when
#    a negotiation has failed specifically because the server requires
#    parameters more secure than those supported by the client.
# 
# internal_error:  An internal error unrelated to the peer or the
#    correctness of the protocol (such as a memory allocation failure)
#    makes it impossible to continue.
# 
# inappropriate_fallback:  Sent by a server in response to an invalid
#    connection retry attempt from a client (see [RFC7507]).
# 
# missing_extension:  Sent by endpoints that receive a handshake
#    message not containing an extension that is mandatory to send for
#    the offered TLS version or other negotiated parameters.
# 
# unsupported_extension:  Sent by endpoints receiving any handshake
#    message containing an extension known to be prohibited for
#    inclusion in the given handshake message, or including any
#    extensions in a ServerHello or Certificate not first offered in
#    the corresponding ClientHello or CertificateRequest.
# 
# unrecognized_name:  Sent by servers when no server exists identified
#    by the name provided by the client via the "server_name" extension
#    (see [RFC6066]).
# 
# bad_certificate_status_response:  Sent by clients when an invalid or
#    unacceptable OCSP response is provided by the server via the
#    "status_request" extension (see [RFC6066]).
# 
# unknown_psk_identity:  Sent by servers when PSK key establishment is
#    desired but no acceptable PSK identity is provided by the client.
#    Sending this alert is OPTIONAL; servers MAY instead choose to send
#    a "decrypt_error" alert to merely indicate an invalid PSK
#    identity.
# 
# certificate_required:  Sent by servers when a client certificate is
#    desired but none was provided by the client.
# 
# no_application_protocol:  Sent by servers when a client
#    "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension advertises only
#    protocols that the server does not support (see [RFC7301]).
# 
# New Alert values are assigned by IANA as described in Section 11.
