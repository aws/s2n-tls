# 4.5.  SSLv3
#
# While SSLv3 is not a protocol under IETF change control (see
# [SSLv3]), it was the original basis for TLS and most TLS
# implementations also support SSLv3.  The IETF encourages SSLv3
# implementations to adopt the "renegotiation_info" extension and SCSV
# as defined in this document.  The semantics of the SCSV and extension
# are identical to TLS stacks except for the size of the verify_data
# values, which are 36 bytes long each.  Note that this will require
# adding at least minimal extension processing to such stacks.  Clients
# that support SSLv3 and offer secure renegotiation (either via SCSV or
# "renegotiation_info") MUST accept the "renegotiation_info" extension
# from the server, even if the server version is {0x03, 0x00}, and
# behave as described in this specification.  TLS servers that support
# secure renegotiation and support SSLv3 MUST accept SCSV or the
# "renegotiation_info" extension and respond as described in this
# specification even if the offered client version is {0x03, 0x00}.
# SSLv3 does not define the "no_renegotiation" alert (and does
# 
# not offer a way to indicate a refusal to renegotiate at a "warning"
# level).  SSLv3 clients that refuse renegotiation SHOULD use a fatal
# handshake_failure alert.
