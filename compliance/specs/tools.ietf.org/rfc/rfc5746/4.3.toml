# 4.3.  Server Considerations
#
# If the client does not offer the "renegotiation_info" extension or
# the TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV SCSV, then this indicates that
# the client does not support secure renegotiation.  Although the
# attack described in Section 1 looks like two handshakes to the
# 
# server, other attacks may be possible in which the renegotiation is
# seen only by the client.  If servers wish to ensure that such attacks
# are impossible, they need to terminate the connection immediately
# upon failure to negotiate the use of secure renegotiation.  Servers
# that do choose to allow connections from unpatched clients can still
# prevent the attack described in Section 1 by refusing to renegotiate
# over those connections.
# 
# In order to enable clients to probe, even servers that do not support
# renegotiation MUST implement the minimal version of the extension
# described in this document for initial handshakes, thus signaling
# that they have been upgraded.
