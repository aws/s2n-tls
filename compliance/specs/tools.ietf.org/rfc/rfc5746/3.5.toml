# 3.5.  Client Behavior: Secure Renegotiation
#
# This text applies if the connection's "secure_renegotiation" flag is
# set to TRUE (if it is set to FALSE, see Section 4.2).
# 
# o  The client MUST include the "renegotiation_info" extension in the
#    ClientHello, containing the saved client_verify_data.  The SCSV
#    MUST NOT be included.
# 
# o  When a ServerHello is received, the client MUST verify that the
#    "renegotiation_info" extension is present; if it is not, the
#    client MUST abort the handshake.
# 
# o  The client MUST then verify that the first half of the
#    "renegotiated_connection" field is equal to the saved
#    client_verify_data value, and the second half is equal to the
#    saved server_verify_data value.  If they are not, the client MUST
#    abort the handshake.
# 
# o  When the handshake has completed, the client needs to save the new
#    client_verify_data and server_verify_data values.
