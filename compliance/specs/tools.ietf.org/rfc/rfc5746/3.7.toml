# 3.7.  Server Behavior: Secure Renegotiation
#
# This text applies if the connection's "secure_renegotiation" flag is
# set to TRUE (if it is set to FALSE, see Section 4.4).
# 
# o  When a ClientHello is received, the server MUST verify that it
#    does not contain the TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV SCSV.  If
#    the SCSV is present, the server MUST abort the handshake.
# 
# o  The server MUST verify that the "renegotiation_info" extension is
#    present; if it is not, the server MUST abort the handshake.
# 
# o  The server MUST verify that the value of the
#    "renegotiated_connection" field is equal to the saved
#    client_verify_data value; if it is not, the server MUST abort the
#    handshake.
# 
# o  The server MUST include a "renegotiation_info" extension
#    containing the saved client_verify_data and server_verify_data in
#    the ServerHello.
# 
# o  When the handshake has completed, the server needs to save the new
#    client_verify_data and server_verify_data values.
