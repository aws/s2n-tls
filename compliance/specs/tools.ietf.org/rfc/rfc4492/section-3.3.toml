# 3.3.  RSA_fixed_ECDH
#
# This authentication mechanism is identical to ECDSA_fixed_ECDH except
# that the client's certificate MUST be signed with RSA.
# 
# Note that while the ECDSA_sign, ECDSA_fixed_ECDH, and RSA_fixed_ECDH
# client authentication mechanisms require the client's certificate to
# be signed with a particular signature scheme, this specification does
# not impose restrictions on signature schemes used elsewhere in the
# certificate chain.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and it
# is expected that this will be taken into account in certification
# authorities' signing practices.  However, such restrictions are not
# strictly required in general: Even if it is beyond the capabilities
# of a server to completely validate a given chain, the server may be
# able to validate the clients certificate by relying on a trust anchor
# that appears as one of the intermediate certificates in the chain.)
