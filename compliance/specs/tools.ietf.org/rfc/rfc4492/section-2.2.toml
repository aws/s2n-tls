# 2.2.  ECDHE_ECDSA
#
# In ECDHE_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDSA-
# capable public key and be signed with ECDSA.
# 
# The server sends its ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of
# the corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These
# parameters MUST be signed with ECDSA using the private key
# corresponding to the public key in the server's Certificate.
# 
# The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the
# server's ephemeral ECDH key and sends its public key in the
# ClientKeyExchange message.
# 
# Both client and server perform an ECDH operation (Section 5.10) and
# use the resultant shared secret as the premaster secret.
