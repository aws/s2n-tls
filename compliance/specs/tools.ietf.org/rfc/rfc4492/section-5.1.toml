# 5.1.  Client Hello Extensions
#
# This section specifies two TLS extensions that can be included with
# the ClientHello message as described in [4], the Supported Elliptic
# Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats Extension.
# 
# When these extensions are sent:
# 
# The extensions SHOULD be sent along with any ClientHello message that
# proposes ECC cipher suites.
# 
# Meaning of these extensions:
# 
# These extensions allow a client to enumerate the elliptic curves it
# supports and/or the point formats it can parse.
# 
# Structure of these extensions:
# 
# The general structure of TLS extensions is described in [4], and this
# specification adds two new types to ExtensionType.
# 
#     enum { elliptic_curves(10), ec_point_formats(11) } ExtensionType;
# 
# elliptic_curves (Supported Elliptic Curves Extension):   Indicates
#    the set of elliptic curves supported by the client.  For this
#    extension, the opaque extension_data field contains
#    EllipticCurveList.  See Section 5.1.1 for details.
# 
# ec_point_formats (Supported Point Formats Extension):   Indicates the
#    set of point formats that the client can parse.  For this
#    extension, the opaque extension_data field contains
#    ECPointFormatList.  See Section 5.1.2 for details.
# 
# Actions of the sender:
# 
# A client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello message
# appends these extensions (along with any others), enumerating the
# curves it supports and the point formats it can parse.  Clients
# SHOULD send both the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the
# Supported Point Formats Extension.  If the Supported Point Formats
# Extension is indeed sent, it MUST contain the value 0 (uncompressed)
# as one of the items in the list of point formats.
# 
# Actions of the receiver:
# 
# A server that receives a ClientHello containing one or both of these
# extensions MUST use the client's enumerated capabilities to guide its
# selection of an appropriate cipher suite.  One of the proposed ECC
# cipher suites must be negotiated only if the server can successfully
# complete the handshake while using the curves and point formats
# supported by the client (cf. Sections 5.3 and 5.4).
# 
# NOTE: A server participating in an ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange may use
# different curves for (i) the ECDSA key in its certificate, and (ii)
# the ephemeral ECDH key in the ServerKeyExchange message.  The server
# must consider the extensions in both cases.
# 
# If a server does not understand the Supported Elliptic Curves
# Extension, does not understand the Supported Point Formats Extension,
# or is unable to complete the ECC handshake while restricting itself
# to the enumerated curves and point formats, it MUST NOT negotiate the
# use of an ECC cipher suite.  Depending on what other cipher suites
# are proposed by the client and supported by the server, this may
# result in a fatal handshake failure alert due to the lack of common
# cipher suites.
