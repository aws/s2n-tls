# 2.1.  ECDH_ECDSA
#
# In ECDH_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDH-capable
# public key and be signed with ECDSA.
# 
# A ServerKeyExchange MUST NOT be sent (the server's certificate
# contains all the necessary keying information required by the client
# to arrive at the premaster secret).
# 
# The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the
# server's long-term public key and sends its public key in the
# ClientKeyExchange message (except when using client authentication
# algorithm ECDSA_fixed_ECDH or RSA_fixed_ECDH, in which case the
# modifications from Section 3.2 or Section 3.3 apply).
# 
# Both client and server perform an ECDH operation and use the
# resultant shared secret as the premaster secret.  All ECDH
# calculations are performed as specified in Section 5.10.
