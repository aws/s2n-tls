# 5.1.2.  Supported Point Formats Extension

#      enum { uncompressed (0), ansiX962_compressed_prime (1),
#             ansiX962_compressed_char2 (2), reserved (248..255)

# 
# Three point formats are included in the definition of ECPointFormat
# above.  The uncompressed point format is the default format in that
# implementations of this document MUST support it for all of their
# supported curves.  Compressed point formats reduce bandwidth by
# including only the x-coordinate and a single bit of the y-coordinate
# of the point.  Implementations of this document MAY support the
# ansiX962_compressed_prime and ansiX962_compressed_char2 formats,
# where the former applies only to prime curves and the latter applies
# only to characteristic-2 curves.  (These formats are specified in
# [7].)  Values 248 through 255 are reserved for private use.
# 
# The ECPointFormat name space is maintained by IANA.  See Section 8
# for information on how new value assignments are added.
# 
# Items in ec_point_format_list are ordered according to the client's
# preferences (favorite choice first).
# 
# A client that can parse only the uncompressed point format (value 0)
# includes an extension consisting of the following octets; note that
# the first two octets indicate the extension type (Supported Point
# Formats Extension):
# 
#      00 0B 00 02 01 00
# 
# A client that in the case of prime fields prefers the compressed
# format (ansiX962_compressed_prime, value 1) over the uncompressed
# format (value 0), but in the case of characteristic-2 fields prefers
# the uncompressed format (value 0) over the compressed format
# (ansiX962_compressed_char2, value 2), may indicate these preferences
# by including an extension consisting of the following octets:
# 
#      00 0B 00 04 03 01 00 02
