# 4.  TLS Extensions for ECC
#
# Two TLS extensions are defined in this specification: (i) the
# Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and (ii) the Supported Point
# Formats Extension.  These allow negotiating the use of specific
# curves and point formats (e.g., compressed vs. uncompressed,
# respectively) during a handshake starting a new session.  These
# extensions are especially relevant for constrained clients that may
# only support a limited number of curves or point formats.  They
# follow the general approach outlined in [RFC4366]; message details
# are specified in Section 5.  The client enumerates the curves it
# supports and the point formats it can parse by including the
# appropriate extensions in its ClientHello message.  The server
# similarly enumerates the point formats it can parse by including an
# extension in its ServerHello message.
# 
# A TLS client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello
# message SHOULD include these extensions.  Servers implementing ECC
# cipher suites MUST support these extensions, and when a client uses
# these extensions, servers MUST NOT negotiate the use of an ECC cipher
# suite unless they can complete the handshake while respecting the
# choice of curves specified by the client.  This eliminates the
# possibility that a negotiated ECC handshake will be subsequently
# aborted due to a client's inability to deal with the server's EC key.
# 
# The client MUST NOT include these extensions in the ClientHello
# message if it does not propose any ECC cipher suites.  A client that
# proposes ECC cipher suites may choose not to include these
# extensions.  In this case, the server is free to choose any one of
# the elliptic curves or point formats listed in Section 5.  That
# section also describes the structure and processing of these
# extensions in greater detail.
# 
# In the case of session resumption, the server simply ignores the
# Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats
# Extension appearing in the current ClientHello message.  These
# extensions only play a role during handshakes negotiating a new
# session.
