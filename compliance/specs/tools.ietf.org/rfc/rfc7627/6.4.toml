# 6.4.  No SSL 3.0 Support
#
# The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol version 3.0 [RFC6101] is a
# predecessor of the TLS protocol, and it is equally vulnerable to
# triple handshake attacks, alongside other vulnerabilities stemming
# from its use of obsolete cryptographic constructions that are now
# considered weak.  SSL 3.0 has been deprecated [RFC7568].
# 
# The countermeasure described in this document relies on a TLS
# extension and hence cannot be used with SSL 3.0.  Clients and servers
# implementing this document SHOULD refuse SSL 3.0 handshakes.  If they
# choose to support SSL 3.0, the resulting sessions MUST use the legacy
# master secret computation, and the interoperability considerations of
# Section 5.4 apply.
