# 5.1.  Extension Definition
#
# This document defines a new TLS extension, "extended_master_secret"
# (with extension type 0x0017), which is used to signal both client and
# server to use the extended master secret computation.  The
# "extension_data" field of this extension is empty.  Thus, the entire
# encoding of the extension is 00 17 00 00 (in hexadecimal.)
# 
# Although this document refers only to TLS, the extension proposed
# here can also be used with Datagram TLS (DTLS) [RFC6347].
# 
# If the client and server agree on this extension and a full handshake
# takes place, both client and server MUST use the extended master
# secret derivation algorithm, as defined in Section 4.  All other
# cryptographic computations remain unchanged.
