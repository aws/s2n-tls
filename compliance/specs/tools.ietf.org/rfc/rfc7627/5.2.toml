# 5.2.  Client and Server Behavior: Full Handshake
#
# In the following, we use the phrase "abort the handshake" as
# shorthand for terminating the handshake by sending a fatal
# "handshake_failure" alert.
# 
# In all handshakes, a client implementing this document MUST send the
# "extended_master_secret" extension in its ClientHello.
# 
# If a server implementing this document receives the
# "extended_master_secret" extension, it MUST include the extension in
# its ServerHello message.
# 
# If both the ClientHello and ServerHello contain the extension, the
# new session uses the extended master secret computation.
# 
# If the server receives a ClientHello without the extension, it SHOULD
# abort the handshake if it does not wish to interoperate with legacy
# clients.  If it chooses to continue the handshake, then it MUST NOT
# include the extension in the ServerHello.
# 
# If a client receives a ServerHello without the extension, it SHOULD
# abort the handshake if it does not wish to interoperate with legacy
# servers.
# 
# If the client and server choose to continue a full handshake without
# the extension, they MUST use the standard master secret derivation
# for the new session.  In this case, the new session is not protected
# by the mechanisms described in this document.  So, implementers
# should follow the guidelines in Section 5.4 to avoid dangerous usage
# scenarios.  In particular, the master secret derived from the new
# session should not be used for application-level authentication.
