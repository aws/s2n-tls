# E.1.4.  Exporter Independence
#
# The exporter_master_secret and early_exporter_master_secret are
# derived to be independent of the traffic keys and therefore do not
# represent a threat to the security of traffic encrypted with those
# keys.  However, because these secrets can be used to compute any
# exporter value, they SHOULD be erased as soon as possible.  If the
# total set of exporter labels is known, then implementations SHOULD
# pre-compute the inner Derive-Secret stage of the exporter computation
# for all those labels, then erase the [early_]exporter_master_secret,
# followed by each inner value as soon as it is known that it will not
# be needed again.
