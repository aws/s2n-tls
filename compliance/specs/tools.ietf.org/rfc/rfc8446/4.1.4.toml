# 4.1.4.  Hello Retry Request
#
# The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello
# message if it is able to find an acceptable set of parameters but the
# ClientHello does not contain sufficient information to proceed with
# the handshake.  As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the HelloRetryRequest
# has the same format as a ServerHello message, and the legacy_version,
# legacy_session_id_echo, cipher_suite, and legacy_compression_method
# fields have the same meaning.  However, for convenience we discuss
# "HelloRetryRequest" throughout this document as if it were a distinct
# message.
# 
# The server's extensions MUST contain "supported_versions".
# Additionally, it SHOULD contain the minimal set of extensions
# necessary for the client to generate a correct ClientHello pair.  As
# with the ServerHello, a HelloRetryRequest MUST NOT contain any
# extensions that were not first offered by the client in its
# ClientHello, with the exception of optionally the "cookie" (see
# Section 4.2.2) extension.
# 
# Upon receipt of a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST check the
# legacy_version, legacy_session_id_echo, cipher_suite, and
# legacy_compression_method as specified in Section 4.1.3 and then
# process the extensions, starting with determining the version using
# "supported_versions".  Clients MUST abort the handshake with an
# "illegal_parameter" alert if the HelloRetryRequest would not result
# in any change in the ClientHello.  If a client receives a second
# HelloRetryRequest in the same connection (i.e., where the ClientHello
# was itself in response to a HelloRetryRequest), it MUST abort the
# handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert.
# 
# Otherwise, the client MUST process all extensions in the
# HelloRetryRequest and send a second updated ClientHello.  The
# HelloRetryRequest extensions defined in this specification are:
# 
# -  supported_versions (see Section 4.2.1)
# 
# -  cookie (see Section 4.2.2)
# 
# -  key_share (see Section 4.2.8)
# 
# A client which receives a cipher suite that was not offered MUST
# abort the handshake.  Servers MUST ensure that they negotiate the
# same cipher suite when receiving a conformant updated ClientHello (if
# the server selects the cipher suite as the first step in the
# negotiation, then this will happen automatically).  Upon receiving
# the ServerHello, clients MUST check that the cipher suite supplied in
# the ServerHello is the same as that in the HelloRetryRequest and
# otherwise abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.
# 
# In addition, in its updated ClientHello, the client SHOULD NOT offer
# any pre-shared keys associated with a hash other than that of the
# selected cipher suite.  This allows the client to avoid having to
# compute partial hash transcripts for multiple hashes in the second
# ClientHello.
# 
# The value of selected_version in the HelloRetryRequest
# "supported_versions" extension MUST be retained in the ServerHello,
# and a client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter"
# alert if the value changes.
