# C.4.  Client Tracking Prevention
#
# Clients SHOULD NOT reuse a ticket for multiple connections.  Reuse of
# a ticket allows passive observers to correlate different connections.
# Servers that issue tickets SHOULD offer at least as many tickets as
# the number of connections that a client might use; for example, a web
# browser using HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] might open six connections to a
# server.  Servers SHOULD issue new tickets with every connection.
# This ensures that clients are always able to use a new ticket when
# creating a new connection.
