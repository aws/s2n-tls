# E.5.1.  Replay and Exporters
#
# Replays of the ClientHello produce the same early exporter, thus
# requiring additional care by applications which use these exporters.
# In particular, if these exporters are used as an authentication
# channel binding (e.g., by signing the output of the exporter), an
# attacker who compromises the PSK can transplant authenticators
# between connections without compromising the authentication key.
# 
# In addition, the early exporter SHOULD NOT be used to generate
# server-to-client encryption keys because that would entail the reuse
# of those keys.  This parallels the use of the early application
# traffic keys only in the client-to-server direction.
