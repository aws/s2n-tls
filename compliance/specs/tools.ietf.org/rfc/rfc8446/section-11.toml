# 11.  IANA Considerations
#
# This document uses several registries that were originally created in
# [RFC4346] and updated in [RFC8447].  IANA has updated these to
# reference this document.  The registries and their allocation
# policies are below:
# 
# -  TLS Cipher Suites registry: values with the first byte in the
#    range 0-254 (decimal) are assigned via Specification Required
#    [RFC8126].  Values with the first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved
#    for Private Use [RFC8126].
# 
#    IANA has added the cipher suites listed in Appendix B.4 to the
#    registry.  The "Value" and "Description" columns are taken from
#    the table.  The "DTLS-OK" and "Recommended" columns are both
#    marked as "Y" for each new cipher suite.
# 
# -  TLS ContentType registry: Future values are allocated via
#    Standards Action [RFC8126].
# 
# -  TLS Alerts registry: Future values are allocated via Standards
#    Action [RFC8126].  IANA has populated this registry with the
#    values from Appendix B.2.  The "DTLS-OK" column is marked as "Y"
#    for all such values.  Values marked as "_RESERVED" have comments
#    describing their previous usage.
# 
# -  TLS HandshakeType registry: Future values are allocated via
#    Standards Action [RFC8126].  IANA has updated this registry to
#    rename item 4 from "NewSessionTicket" to "new_session_ticket" and
#    populated this registry with the values from Appendix B.3.  The
#    "DTLS-OK" column is marked as "Y" for all such values.  Values
#    marked "_RESERVED" have comments describing their previous or
#    temporary usage.
# 
# This document also uses the TLS ExtensionType Values registry
# originally created in [RFC4366].  IANA has updated it to reference
# this document.  Changes to the registry follow:
# 
# -  IANA has updated the registration policy as follows:
# 
#    Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are
#    assigned via Specification Required [RFC8126].  Values with the
#    first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [RFC8126].
# 
# -  IANA has updated this registry to include the "key_share",
#    "pre_shared_key", "psk_key_exchange_modes", "early_data",
#    "cookie", "supported_versions", "certificate_authorities",
#    "oid_filters", "post_handshake_auth", and
#    "signature_algorithms_cert" extensions with the values defined in
#    this document and the "Recommended" value of "Y".
# 
# -  IANA has updated this registry to include a "TLS 1.3" column which
#    lists the messages in which the extension may appear.  This column
#    has been initially populated from the table in Section 4.2, with
#    any extension not listed there marked as "-" to indicate that it
#    is not used by TLS 1.3.
# 
# This document updates an entry in the TLS Certificate Types registry
# originally created in [RFC6091] and updated in [RFC8447].  IANA has
# updated the entry for value 1 to have the name "OpenPGP_RESERVED",
# "Recommended" value "N", and comment "Used in TLS versions prior
# to 1.3."
# 
# This document updates an entry in the TLS Certificate Status Types
# registry originally created in [RFC6961].  IANA has updated the entry
# for value 2 to have the name "ocsp_multi_RESERVED" and comment "Used
# in TLS versions prior to 1.3".
# 
# This document updates two entries in the TLS Supported Groups
# registry (created under a different name by [RFC4492]; now maintained
# by [RFC8422]) and updated by [RFC7919] and [RFC8447].  The entries
# for values 29 and 30 (x25519 and x448) have been updated to also
# refer to this document.
# 
# In addition, this document defines two new registries that are
# maintained by IANA:
# 
# -  TLS SignatureScheme registry: Values with the first byte in the
#    range 0-253 (decimal) are assigned via Specification Required
#    [RFC8126].  Values with the first byte 254 or 255 (decimal) are
#    reserved for Private Use [RFC8126].  Values with the first byte in
#    the range 0-6 or with the second byte in the range 0-3 that are
#    not currently allocated are reserved for backward compatibility.
#    This registry has a "Recommended" column.  The registry has been
#    initially populated with the values described in Section 4.2.3.
#    The following values are marked as "Recommended":
#    ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256, ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384,
#    rsa_pss_rsae_sha256, rsa_pss_rsae_sha384, rsa_pss_rsae_sha512,
#    rsa_pss_pss_sha256, rsa_pss_pss_sha384, rsa_pss_pss_sha512, and
#    ed25519.  The "Recommended" column is assigned a value of "N"
#    unless explicitly requested, and adding a value with a
#    "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards Action [RFC8126].
#    IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y->N transition.
# 
# -  TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry: Values in the range 0-253
#    (decimal) are assigned via Specification Required [RFC8126].
#    The values 254 and 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use
#    [RFC8126].  This registry has a "Recommended" column.  The
#    registry has been initially populated with psk_ke (0) and
#    psk_dhe_ke (1).  Both are marked as "Recommended".  The
#    "Recommended" column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly
#    requested, and adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y"
#    requires Standards Action [RFC8126].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED
#    for a Y->N transition.
