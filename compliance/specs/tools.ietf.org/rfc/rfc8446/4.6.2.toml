# 4.6.2.  Post-Handshake Authentication
#
# When the client has sent the "post_handshake_auth" extension (see
# Section 4.2.6), a server MAY request client authentication at any
# time after the handshake has completed by sending a
# CertificateRequest message.  The client MUST respond with the
# appropriate Authentication messages (see Section 4.4).  If the client
# chooses to authenticate, it MUST send Certificate, CertificateVerify,
# 
# and Finished.  If it declines, it MUST send a Certificate message
# containing no certificates followed by Finished.  All of the client's
# messages for a given response MUST appear consecutively on the wire
# with no intervening messages of other types.
# 
# A client that receives a CertificateRequest message without having
# sent the "post_handshake_auth" extension MUST send an
# "unexpected_message" fatal alert.
# 
# Note: Because client authentication could involve prompting the user,
# servers MUST be prepared for some delay, including receiving an
# arbitrary number of other messages between sending the
# CertificateRequest and receiving a response.  In addition, clients
# which receive multiple CertificateRequests in close succession MAY
# respond to them in a different order than they were received (the
# certificate_request_context value allows the server to disambiguate
# the responses).
