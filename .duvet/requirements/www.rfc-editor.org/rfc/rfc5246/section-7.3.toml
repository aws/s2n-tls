# 7.3.  Handshake Protocol Overview
#
# The cryptographic parameters of the session state are produced by the
# TLS Handshake Protocol, which operates on top of the TLS record
# layer.  When a TLS client and server first start communicating, they
# agree on a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms,
# optionally authenticate each other, and use public-key encryption
# techniques to generate shared secrets.
# 
# The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:
# 
# -  Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random
#    values, and check for session resumption.
# 
# -  Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the
#    client and server to agree on a premaster secret.
# 
# -  Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the
#    client and server to authenticate themselves.
# 
# -  Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged
#    random values.
# 
# -  Provide security parameters to the record layer.
# 
# -  Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has
#    calculated the same security parameters and that the handshake
#    occurred without tampering by an attacker.
# 
# Note that higher layers should not be overly reliant on whether TLS
# always negotiates the strongest possible connection between two
# peers.  There are a number of ways in which a man-in-the-middle
# attacker can attempt to make two entities drop down to the least
# secure method they support.  The protocol has been designed to
# minimize this risk, but there are still attacks available: for
# example, an attacker could block access to the port a secure service
# runs on, or attempt to get the peers to negotiate an unauthenticated
# connection.  The fundamental rule is that higher levels must be
# cognizant of what their security requirements are and never transmit
# information over a channel less secure than what they require.  The
# TLS protocol is secure in that any cipher suite offers its promised
# level of security: if you negotiate 3DES with a 1024-bit RSA key
# exchange with a host whose certificate you have verified, you can
# expect to be that secure.
# 
# These goals are achieved by the handshake protocol, which can be
# summarized as follows: The client sends a ClientHello message to
# which the server must respond with a ServerHello message, or else a
# fatal error will occur and the connection will fail.  The ClientHello
# and ServerHello are used to establish security enhancement
# capabilities between client and server.  The ClientHello and
# ServerHello establish the following attributes: Protocol Version,
# Session ID, Cipher Suite, and Compression Method.  Additionally, two
# random values are generated and exchanged: ClientHello.random and
# ServerHello.random.
# 
# The actual key exchange uses up to four messages: the server
# Certificate, the ServerKeyExchange, the client Certificate, and the
# ClientKeyExchange.  New key exchange methods can be created by
# specifying a format for these messages and by defining the use of the
# messages to allow the client and server to agree upon a shared
# secret.  This secret MUST be quite long; currently defined key
# exchange methods exchange secrets that range from 46 bytes upwards.
# 
# Following the hello messages, the server will send its certificate in
# a Certificate message if it is to be authenticated.  Additionally, a
# ServerKeyExchange message may be sent, if it is required (e.g., if
# the server has no certificate, or if its certificate is for signing
# only).  If the server is authenticated, it may request a certificate
# from the client, if that is appropriate to the cipher suite selected.
# Next, the server will send the ServerHelloDone message, indicating
# that the hello-message phase of the handshake is complete.  The
# server will then wait for a client response.  If the server has sent
# a CertificateRequest message, the client MUST send the Certificate
# message.  The ClientKeyExchange message is now sent, and the content
# of that message will depend on the public key algorithm selected
# between the ClientHello and the ServerHello.  If the client has sent
# a certificate with signing ability, a digitally-signed
# CertificateVerify message is sent to explicitly verify possession of
# the private key in the certificate.
# 
# At this point, a ChangeCipherSpec message is sent by the client, and
# the client copies the pending Cipher Spec into the current Cipher
# Spec.  The client then immediately sends the Finished message under
# the new algorithms, keys, and secrets.  In response, the server will
# send its own ChangeCipherSpec message, transfer the pending to the
# current Cipher Spec, and send its Finished message under the new
# Cipher Spec.  At this point, the handshake is complete, and the
# client and server may begin to exchange application layer data.  (See
# flow chart below.)  Application data MUST NOT be sent prior to the
# completion of the first handshake (before a cipher suite other than
# TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL is established).

# Note: To help avoid pipeline stalls, ChangeCipherSpec is an
# independent TLS protocol content type, and is not actually a TLS
# handshake message.
# 
# When the client and server decide to resume a previous session or
# duplicate an existing session (instead of negotiating new security
# parameters), the message flow is as follows:
# 
# The client sends a ClientHello using the Session ID of the session to
# be resumed.  The server then checks its session cache for a match.
# If a match is found, and the server is willing to re-establish the
# connection under the specified session state, it will send a
# ServerHello with the same Session ID value.  At this point, both
# client and server MUST send ChangeCipherSpec messages and proceed
# directly to Finished messages.  Once the re-establishment is
# complete, the client and server MAY begin to exchange application
# layer data.  (See flow chart below.)  If a Session ID match is not
# found, the server generates a new session ID, and the TLS client and
# server perform a full handshake.
