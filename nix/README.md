# Nix  and s2n-tls

*Note*: this is a WIP.

[s2n-tls](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/libraries/s2n-tls/default.nix) is already park of [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) upstream.

### Flakes for unit testing

To run the unit tests, setup nix and flakes, then run:

```
nix build
```

from the s2n-tls directory.
