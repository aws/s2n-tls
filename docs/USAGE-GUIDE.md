# Using s2n

s2n is a C library, and is built using Make. To clone the latest
copy of s2n from git use:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/s2n.git
cd s2n
```

## Building s2n with existing libcrypto
### make Instructions
To build s2n with an existing libcrypto installation, store its root folder in the
`LIBCRYPTO_ROOT` environment variable.
```shell
# /usr/local/ssl/lib should contain libcrypto.a
LIBCRYPTO_ROOT=/usr/local/ssl make
```
### CMake Instructions

Throughout this document, there are instructions for setting a `LIBCRYPTO_ROOT` environment variable, or setting install prefixes to `s2n/lib-crypto-root`. If you 
are using CMake that step is unnecessary. Just follow the instructions here to use any build of libcrypto.

(Required): You need at least CMake version 3.0 to fully benefit from Modern CMake. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXLMQ6WgIk) for more information.

(Optional): Set the CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the location libcrypto is installed to. If you do not,
the default installation on your machine will be used.

(Optional): Set the CMake variable `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to build shared libraries. The default is static.
 
We recommend an out-of-source build. Suppose you have a directory `s2n` which contains the s2n source code. At the same level
we can create a directory called `s2n-build`

For example, we can build and install shared libs using ninja as our build system, and the system libcrypto implementation.

````shell
mkdir s2n-build
cd s2n-build
cmake ../s2n -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -GNinja
ninja
ninja test 
sudo ninja install
````

For another example, we can prepare an Xcode project using static libs using a libcrypto implementation in the directory `$HOME/s2n-user/builds/libcrypto-impl`.

````shell
mkdir s2n-build
cd s2n-build
cmake ../s2n -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/s2n-user/builds/libcrypto-impl -G "Xcode"
# now open the project in Xcode and build from there, or use the Xcode CLI
````

Or, for unix style vanilla builds:

````shell
mkdir s2n-build
cd s2n-build
cmake ../s2n
make
make test
sudo make install
````

### Consuming s2n via. CMake
s2n ships with modern CMake finder scripts if CMake is used for the build. To take advantage of this from your CMake script, all you need to do to compile and link against s2n in your project is:

````shell
find_package(s2n)

....

target_link_libraries(yourExecutableOrLibrary AWS::s2n)
````

And when invoking CMake for your project, do one of two things:
 1. Set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable with the path to your s2n build.
 2. If you have globally installed s2n, do nothing, it will automatically be found.
 
## Building s2n with OpenSSL-1.1.1

To build s2n with OpenSSL-1.1.1, do the following:

```shell
# We keep the build artifacts in the -build directory
cd libcrypto-build

# Download the latest version of OpenSSL
curl -LO https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1-latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf openssl-1.1.1-latest.tar.gz

# Build openssl libcrypto
cd `tar ztf openssl-1.1.1-latest.tar.gz | head -n1 | cut -f1 -d/`
./config -fPIC no-shared              \
         no-md2 no-rc5 no-rfc3779 no-sctp no-ssl-trace no-zlib     \

## Building s2n with LibreSSL

To build s2n with LibreSSL, do the following:

```shell
# We keep the build artifacts in the -build directory
cd libcrypto-build

# Download the latest version of LibreSSL
curl -O http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-x.y.z.tar.gz
tar -xzvf libressl-x.y.z.tar.gz

# Build LibreSSL's libcrypto
cd libressl-x.y.z
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../../libcrypto-root/
make CFLAGS=-fPIC install

# Build s2n
cd ../../
make
```

once built, static and dynamic libraries for s2n will be available in the lib/
directory.

## Building s2n with BoringSSL

To build s2n with BoringSSL, you must check out a copy of the BoringSSL
directly via git. This procedure has been tested with
fb68d6c901b98ffe15b8890d00bc819bf44c5f01 of BoringSSL.

```shell
# We keep the build artifacts in the -build directory
cd libcrypto-build

# Clone BoringSSL
git clone https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl
    
# Build BoringSSL
cd boringssl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fPIC" ../
make

# Copy the built library and includes
mkdir ../../../libcrypto-root/lib/
cp crypto/libcrypto.a ../../../libcrypto-root/lib/
cp -r ../include/ ../../../libcrypto-root/include

# Build s2n
cd ../../../
make
```

once built, static and dynamic libraries for s2n will be available in the lib/
directory.

## mlock() and system limits 

Internally s2n uses mlock() to prevent memory from being swapped to disk. The
s2n build tests may fail in some environments where the default limit on locked
memory is too low. To check this limit, run:

```shell
ulimit -l
```

to raise the limit, consult the documentation for your platform.

### Disabling mlock()
To disable s2n's mlock behavior, run your application with the `S2N_DONT_MLOCK` environment variable set. 
s2n also reads this for unit tests. Try `S2N_DONT_MLOCK=1 make` if you're having mlock failures during unit tests.

# s2n API

The API exposed by s2n is the set of functions and declarations that
are in the "s2n.h" header file. Any functions and declarations that are in the "s2n.h" file
are intended to be stable (API and ABI) within major version numbers of s2n releases. Other functions 
and structures used in s2n internally can not be considered stable and their parameters, names, and 
sizes may change.

At this time (Summer 2015), there has been no numbered release of s2n and all APIs are subject to change based
on the feedback and preferences of early adopters.

## Preprocessor macros

s2n defines five preprocessor macros that are used to determine what 
version of SSL/TLS is in use on a connection. 

```c
#define S2N_SSLv2 20
#define S2N_SSLv3 30
#define S2N_TLS10 31
#define S2N_TLS11 32
#define S2N_TLS12 33
```

These correspond to SSL2.0, SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 respectively.
Note that s2n does not support SSL2.0 for sending and receiving encrypted data,
but does accept SSL2.0 hello messages.

## Enums

s2n defines the following enum types:

### s2n_error_type

```c
typedef enum {
    S2N_ERR_T_OK=0,
    S2N_ERR_T_IO,
    S2N_ERR_T_CLOSED,
    S2N_ERR_T_BLOCKED,
    S2N_ERR_T_ALERT,
    S2N_ERR_T_PROTO,
    S2N_ERR_T_INTERNAL,
    S2N_ERR_T_USAGE
} s2n_error_type;
```

***s2n_error_type*** is used to help applications determine why an s2n function failed.
This enum is optimized for use in C switch statements. Each value in the enum represents
an error "category". See [Error Handling](#error-handling) for more detail.

### s2n_mode

```c
typedef enum { S2N_SERVER, S2N_CLIENT } s2n_mode;
```

**s2n_mode** is used to declare connections as server or client type,
respectively.  At this time, s2n does not function as a client and only
S2N_SERVER should be used.

### s2n_blocked_status

```c
typedef enum { S2N_NOT_BLOCKED, S2N_BLOCKED_ON_READ, S2N_BLOCKED_ON_WRITE } s2n_blocked_status;
```

**s2n_blocked_status** is used in non-blocking mode to indicate in which
direction s2n became blocked on I/O before it returned control to the caller.
This allows an application to avoid retrying s2n operations until I/O is 
possible in that direction.

### s2n_blinding

```c
typedef enum { S2N_BUILT_IN_BLINDING, S2N_SELF_SERVICE_BLINDING } s2n_blinding;
```

**s2n_blinding** is used to opt-out of s2n's built-in blinding. Blinding is a
mitigation against timing side-channels which in some cases can leak information
about encrypted data. By default s2n will cause a thread to sleep between 10 and 
30 seconds whenever tampering is detected. 

Setting the **S2N_SELF_SERVICE_BLINDING** option with **s2n_connection_set_blinding**
turns off this behavior. This is useful for applications that are handling many connections
in a single thread. In that case, if s2n_recv() or s2n_negotiate() return an error, 
self-service applications should call **s2n_connection_get_delay** and pause 
activity on the connection  for the specified number of nanoseconds before calling
close() or shutdown().

### s2n_status_request_type

```c
typedef enum { S2N_STATUS_REQUEST_NONE, S2N_STATUS_REQUEST_OCSP } s2n_status_request_type;
```

**s2n_status_request_type** is used to define the type, if any, of certificate
status request an S2N_CLIENT should make during the handshake. The only
supported status request type is OCSP, **S2N_STATUS_REQUEST_OCSP**.

### s2n_cert_auth_type

```c
typedef enum { S2N_CERT_AUTH_NONE, S2N_CERT_AUTH_REQUIRED, S2N_CERT_AUTH_OPTIONAL } s2n_cert_auth_type;
```
**s2n_cert_auth_type** is used to declare what type of client certificiate authentication to use.
Currently the default for s2n is for neither the server side or the client side to use Client (aka Mutual) authentication.

## Opaque structures

s2n defines several opaque structures that are used for managed objects. Because
these structures are opaque, they can only be safely referenced indirectly through
pointers and their sizes may change with future versions of s2n.

```c
struct s2n_config;
struct s2n_connection;
```

**s2n_config** structures are a configuration object, used by servers for
holding cryptographic certificates, keys and preferences. **s2n_connection**
structures are used to track each connection.


```c
struct s2n_rsa_public_key;
struct s2n_cert_public_key;
```

**s2n_rsa_public_key** and **s2n_cert_public_key** can be used by consumers of s2n to get and set public keys through other API calls.


## Error handling

```
const char *s2n_strerror(int error, const char *lang);
const char *s2n_strerror_debug(int error, const char *lang);
const char *s2n_strerror_name(int error);
````

s2n functions that return 'int' return 0 to indicate success and -1 to indicate
failure. s2n functions that return pointer types return NULL in the case of
failure. When an s2n function returns a failure, s2n_errno will be set to a value
corresponding to the error. This error value can be translated into a string
explaining the error in English by calling s2n_strerror(s2n_errno, "EN").
A string containing human readable error name, can be generated with `s2n_strerror_name`.
A string containing internal debug information, including filename and line number, can be generated with `s2n_strerror_debug`.
This string is useful to include when reporting issues to the s2n development team.

Example:

```
if (s2n_config_set_cipher_preferences(config, prefs) < 0) {
    printf("Setting cipher prefs failed! %s : %s", s2n_strerror(s2n_errno, "EN"), s2n_strerror_debug(s2n_errno, "EN"));
    return -1;
}
```

**NOTE**: To avoid possible confusion, s2n_errno should be cleared after processing an error: `s2n_errno = S2N_ERR_T_OK`

### Stacktraces
s2n has an mechanism to capture stacktraces when errors occur.
This mechanism is off by default, but can be enabled in code by calling `s2n_stack_traces_enabled_set()`.
It can be enabled globally by setting the environment variable `S2N_PRINT_STACKTRACE=1`.
Note that enabling stacktraces this can significantly slow down unit tests, and can cause failures on unit-tests (such as `s2n_cbc_verify`) that measure the timing of events.

```
bool s2n_stack_traces_enabled();
int s2n_stack_traces_enabled_set(bool newval);

int s2n_calculate_stacktrace(void);
int s2n_print_stacktrace(FILE *fptr);
int s2n_free_stacktrace(void);
int s2n_get_stacktrace(char*** trace, int* trace_size);
```

### Error categories

s2n organizes errors into different "types" to allow applications to do logic on error values without catching all possibilities. 
Applications using non-blocking I/O should check error type to determine if the I/O operation failed because it would block or for some other error. To retrieve the type for a given error use `s2n_error_get_type()`.
Applications should perform any error handling logic using these high level types:

```
S2N_ERR_T_OK=0, /* No error */
S2N_ERR_T_IO, /* Underlying I/O operation failed, check system errno */
S2N_ERR_T_CLOSED, /* EOF */
S2N_ERR_T_BLOCKED, /* Underlying I/O operation would block */
S2N_ERR_T_ALERT, /* Incoming Alert */
S2N_ERR_T_PROTO, /* Failure in some part of the TLS protocol. Ex: CBC verification failure */
S2N_ERR_T_INTERNAL, /* Error internal to s2n. A precondition could have failed. */
S2N_ERR_T_USAGE /* User input error. Ex: Providing an invalid cipher preference version */
```

Here's an example that handles errors based on type:

```
s2n_errno = S2N_ERR_T_OK;
if (s2n_recv(conn, &blocked) < 0) {
    switch(s2n_error_get_type(s2n_errno)) {
        case S2N_ERR_T_BLOCKED:
            /* Blocked, come back later */
            return -1;
        case S2N_ERR_T_CLOSED:
            return 0;
        case S2N_ERR_T_IO:
            handle_io_err();
            return -1;
        case S2N_ERR_T_PROTO:
            handle_proto_err();
            return -1;
        case S2N_ERR_T_ALERT:
            log_alert(s2n_connection_get_alert(conn));
            return -1;
        /* Everything else */
        default:
            log_other_error();
            return -1;
    }
}
```


## Initialization and teardown

### s2n\_get\_openssl\_version

```c
unsigned long s2n_get_openssl_version();
```

**s2n_get_openssl_version** returns the version number of OpenSSL that s2n was compiled with. It can be used by 
applications to validate at runtime that the versions of s2n and Openssl that they have loaded are correct.


### s2n\_init

```c
int s2n_init();
```

**s2n_init** initializes the s2n library and should be called once in your application,
before any other s2n functions are called. Failure to call s2n_init() will result
in errors from other s2n functions.

### s2n\_cleanup

```c
int s2n_cleanup();
```

**s2n_cleanup** cleans up any internal resources used by s2n. This function should be
called from each thread or process that is created subsequent to calling **s2n_init**
when that thread or process is done calling other s2n functions.

## Configuration-oriented functions

### s2n\_config\_new

```c
struct s2n_config * s2n_config_new();
```

**s2n_config_new** returns a new configuration object suitable for associating certs and keys.
This object can (and should) be associated with many connection objects. 

### s2n\_config\_free

```c
int s2n_config_free(struct s2n_config *config);
```

**s2n_config_free** frees the memory associated with an **s2n_config** object.

### s2n\_config\_set\_cipher\_preferences

```c
int s2n_config_set_cipher_preferences(struct s2n_config *config,
                                      const char *version);
```

**s2n_config_set_cipher_preferences** sets the ciphersuite and protocol versions. The currently supported versions are;

|    version | SSLv3 | TLS1.0 | TLS1.1 | TLS1.2 | AES-CBC | ChaCha20-Poly1305 | ECDSA | AES-GCM | 3DES | RC4 | DHE | ECDHE |

| "20150202" |       |   X    |    X   |    X   |    X    |                   |       |         |  X   |     |  X  |       |
| "20141001" |       |   X    |    X   |    X   |    X    |                   |       |         |  X   |  X  |  X  |       |

The "default" version is special in that it will be updated with future s2n changes and ciphersuites and protocol versions may be added and removed, or their internal order of preference might change. Numbered versions are fixed and will never change. 

"20160411" follows the same general preference order as "default". The main difference is it has a CBC cipher suite at the top. This is to accomodate certain Java clients that have poor GCM implementations. Users of s2n who have found GCM to be hurting performance for their clients should consider this version.

"20170405" is a FIPS compliant cipher suite preference list based on approved algorithms in the [FIPS 140-2 Annex A](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402annexa.pdf). Similarly to "20160411", this perference list has CBC cipher suites at the top to accomodate certain Java clients. Users of s2n who plan to enable FIPS mode should consider this version.

s2n does not expose an API to control the order of preference for each ciphersuite or protocol version. s2n follows the following order:

*NOTE*: All ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suites will not be available if s2n is not built with an Openssl 1.1.1 libcrypto. The
underlying encrpyt/decrypt functions are not available in older versions.

1. Always prefer the highest protocol version supported
2. Always use forward secrecy where possible. Prefer ECDHE over DHE. 
3. Prefer encryption ciphers in the following order: AES128, AES256, ChaCha20, 3DES, RC4.
4. Prefer record authentication modes in the following order: GCM, Poly1305, SHA256, SHA1, MD5.

### s2n\_config\_set\_signature\_preferences

```c
int s2n_config_set_signature_preferences(struct s2n_config *config,
                                      const char *version);
```

**s2n_config_set_signature_preferences** sets the list of acceptable signature schemes (signature + hash algorithms).

The "default" version behaves as in **s2n_config_set_cipher_preferences**. Numbered versions are fixed and will never change. The currently supported versions are:

| version | definition |
|----------|-----------
|"default" | Currently "20140601".
|"20200207" | RSA-PSS, RSA-RSAE, RSA-PKCS1, and ECDSA. SHA1 allowed, but only as a fallback.
|"20140601" | RSA-PKCS1 and ECDSA. SHA1 allowed, but only as a fallback.

### s2n\_config\_set\_ecc\_preferences

```c
int s2n_config_set_ecc_preferences(struct s2n_config *config,
                                      const char *version);
```

**s2n_config_set_ecc_preferences** sets the list of acceptable ecc curves in descending order of preference.

The "default" version behaves as in **s2n_config_set_cipher_preferences**. Numbered versions are fixed and will never change. The currently supported versions are:

| version | definition |
|----------|-----------
|"default" | Currently "20140601".
|"20200310" | Curves x25519, secp256r1, and secp384r1. 
|"20140601" | Curves secp256r1 and secp384r1. 

### s2n\_config\_add\_cert\_chain\_and\_key

```c
int s2n_config_add_cert_chain_and_key(struct s2n_config *config, 
                                      const char *cert_chain_pem,
                                      const char *private_key_pem);
```

**s2n_config_add_cert_chain_and_key** associates a certificate chain and a
private key, with an **s2n_config** object. At present, only one
certificate-chain/key pair may be associated with a config.

**cert_chain_pem** should be a PEM encoded certificate chain, with the first
certificate in the chain being your servers certificate. **private_key_pem**
should be a PEM encoded private key corresponding to the server certificate.

### s2n\_config\_add\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_to\_store

```c
int s2n_config_add_cert_chain_and_key_to_store(struct s2n_config *config, 
                                               struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *cert_key_pair);
```

**s2n_config_add_cert_chain_and_key_to_store** is the preferred method of associating a certificate chain and private key pair with an **s2n_config** object. It is not recommended to free or modify the **cert_key_pair** as any subsequent changes will be reflected in the config.

**s2n_config_add_cert_chain_and_key_to_store** may be called multiple times to support multiple key types(RSA, ECDSA) and multiple domains. On the server side, the certificate selected will be based on the incoming SNI value and the client's capabilities(supported ciphers). In the case of no certificate matching the client's SNI extension or if no SNI extension was sent by the client, the certificate from the **first** call to **s2n_config_add_cert_chain_and_key_to_store** will be selected.

### s2n\_config\_set\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_defaults

```c
int s2n_config_set_cert_chain_and_key_defaults(struct s2n_config *config,
                                               struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key **cert_key_pairs,
                                               uint32_t num_cert_key_pairs);
```

**s2n_config_set_cert_chain_and_key_defaults** explicitly sets certificate chain and private key pairs to be used as defaults for each auth method (key type). A "default" certificate is used when there is not an SNI match with any other configured certificate. Only one certificate can be set as the default per auth method (one RSA default, one ECDSA default, etc.). All previous default certificates will be cleared and re-set when this API is called. This API is called for a specific **s2n_config** object.

S2N will attempt to automatically choose default certificates for each auth method (key type) based on the order that **s2n_cert_chain_and_key** are added to the **s2n_config** using one of the APIs listed above. **s2n_config_set_cert_chain_and_key_defaults** can be called at any time; s2n will clear defaults and no longer attempt to automatically choose any default certificates.

### s2n\_cert\_tiebreak\_callback
```c
typedef struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key* (*s2n_cert_tiebreak_callback) (struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *cert1, struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *cert2, uint8_t *name, uint32_t name_len);
```

**s2n_cert_tiebreak_callback** is invoked if s2n cannot resolve a conflict between two certificates with the same domain name. This function is invoked while certificates are added to an **s2n_config**.
Currently, the only builtin resolution for domain name conflicts is certificate type(RSA, ECDSA, etc).
The callback should return a pointer to the **s2n_cert_chain_and_key** that should be used for dns name **name**. If NULL is returned, the first certificate will be used.
Typically an application will use properties like trust and expiry to implement tiebreaking.

### s2n\_config\_set\_cert\_tiebreak\_callback
```c
int s2n_config_set_cert_tiebreak_callback(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_cert_tiebreak_callback tiebreak_fn);
```

**s2n_config_set_cert_tiebreak_callback** sets the **s2n_cert_tiebreak_callback** for resolving domain name conflicts. If no callback is set, the first certificate added for a domain name will always be preferred.

### s2n\_config\_add\_dhparams

```c
int s2n_config_add_dhparams(struct s2n_config *config, 
                            char *dhparams_pem);
```

**s2n_config_add_dhparams** associates a set of Diffie-Hellman parameters with
an **s2n_config** object. **dhparams_pem** should be PEM encoded DH parameters.

### s2n\_config\_set\_protocol\_preferences

```c
int s2n_config_set_protocol_preferences(struct s2n_config *config,
                                        const char **protocols,
                                        int protocol_count);
```

**s2n_config_set_protocol_preferences** sets the application protocol
preferences on an **s2n_config** object.  **protocols** is a list in order of
preference, with most preferred protocol first, and of length
**protocol_count**.  When acting as an **S2N_CLIENT** the protocol list is
included in the Client Hello message as the ALPN extension.  As an
**S2N_SERVER**, the list is used to negotiate a mutual application protocol
with the client. After the negotiation for the connection has completed, the
agreed upon protocol can be retrieved with [s2n_get_application_protocol](#s2n_get_application_protocol)

### s2n\_config\_set\_status\_request\_type

```c
int s2n_config_set_status_request_type(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_status_request_type type);
```

**s2n_config_set_status_request_type** Sets up an S2N_CLIENT to request the
server certificate status during an SSL handshake.  If set to
S2N_STATUS_REQUEST_NONE, no status request is made.

### s2n\_config\_set\_extension\_data

```c
int s2n_config_set_extension_data(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_tls_extension_type type, const uint8_t *data, uint32_t length);
```

**s2n_config_set_extension_data** Sets the extension data in the **s2n_config**
object for the specified extension.  This method will clear any existing data
that is set.   If the data and length parameters are set to NULL, no new data
is set in the **s2n_config** object, effectively clearing existing data.

`s2n_tls_extension_type` is defined as:

```c
    typedef enum {
      S2N_EXTENSION_SERVER_NAME = 0,
      S2N_EXTENSION_MAX_FRAG_LEN = 1,
      S2N_EXTENSION_OCSP_STAPLING = 5,
      S2N_EXTENSION_SUPPORTED_GROUPS = 10,
      S2N_EXTENSION_EC_POINT_FORMATS = 11,
      S2N_EXTENSION_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHMS = 13,
      S2N_EXTENSION_ALPN = 16,
      S2N_EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY = 18,
      S2N_EXTENSION_RENEGOTIATION_INFO = 65281,
    } s2n_tls_extension_type;
```

At this time the following extensions are supported:

`S2N_EXTENSION_OCSP_STAPLING` - If a client requests the OCSP status of the server
certificate, this is the response used in the CertificateStatus handshake
message.

`S2N_EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY` - If a client supports receiving SCTs
via the TLS extension (section 3.3.1 of RFC6962) this data is returned within
the extension response during the handshake.  The format of this data is the
SignedCertificateTimestampList structure defined in that document.  See
http://www.certificate-transparency.org/ for more information about Certificate
Transparency.

### s2n\_config\_set\_wall\_clock

```c
int s2n_config_set_wall_clock(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_clock_time_nanoseconds clock_fn, void *data);
```

**s2n_config_set_wall_clock** allows the caller to set a
callback function that will be used to get the system time. The callback function
takes two arguments; a pointer to abitrary data for use within the callback,
and a pointer to a 64 bit unsigned integer. The first pointer will be set to
the value of **data** which supplied by the caller when setting the callback.
The integer pointed to by the second pointer should be set to the number of
nanoseconds since the Unix epoch (Midnight, January 1st, 1970). The function
should return 0 on success and -1 on error. The default implementation, which uses the REALTIME clock,
will be used if this callback is not manually set.

### s2n\_config\_set\_monotonic\_clock

```c
int s2n_config_set_monotonic_clock(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_clock_time_nanoseconds clock_fn, void *data);
```

**s2n_config_set_monotonic_clock** allows the caller to set a
callback function that will be used to get monotonic time. The callback function
takes two arguments; a pointer to abitrary data for use within the callback,
and a pointer to a 64 bit unsigned integer. The first pointer will be set to
the value of **data** which supplied by the caller when setting the callback.
The integer pointed to by the second pointer should be an always increasing value. The function
should return 0 on success and -1 on error. The default implementation, which uses the MONOTONIC clock,
will be used if this callback is not manually set.

### s2n\_config\_set\_verification\_ca\_location
```c
int s2n_config_set_verification_ca_location(struct s2n_config *config, const char *ca_pem_filename, const char *ca_dir);
```

**s2n_config_set_verification_ca_location**  initializes the trust store from a CA file or directory 
containing trusted certificates.  By default, the trust store will be initialized to the common locations 
for the host operating system. Call this function to override that behavior.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

### s2n\_config\_add\_pem\_to\_trust\_store
```c
int s2n_config_add_pem_to_trust_store(struct s2n_config *config, const char *pem);
```

**s2n_config_add_pem_to_trust_store**  Initialize trust store from a PEM. This will allocate memory, and load PEM into the Trust Store

### s2n\_verify\_host\_fn
```c
typedef uint8_t (*s2n_verify_host_fn) (const char *host_name, size_t host_name_len, void *ctx);
```

**s2n_verify_host_fn** is invoked (usually multiple times) during X.509 validation for each name encountered in the leaf certificate. 
Return 1 to trust that hostname or 0 to not trust the hostname. If this function returns 1, then the certificate is considered trusted and that portion
of the X.509 validation will succeed. If no hostname results in a 1 being returned, 
the certificate will be untrusted and the validation will terminate immediately. The default behavior is to reject all host names found in a certificate
if client mode or client authentication is being used..

### s2n\_config\_set\_verify\_host\_callback
```c
int s2n_config_set_verify_host_callback(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_verify_host_fn, void *ctx);
```

**s2n_config_set_verify_host_callback** sets the callback to use for verifying that a hostname from an X.509 certificate 
is trusted. By default, no certificate will be trusted. To override this behavior, set this callback. 
See [s2n_verify_host_fn](#s2n_verify_host_fn) for details. This configuration will be inherited by default to new instances of **s2n_connection**. 
If a separate callback for different connections using the same config is desired, see 
[s2n_connection_set_verify_host_callback](#s2n_connection_set_verify_host_callback).

### s2n\_config\_set\_check\_stapled\_ocsp\_response

```c
int s2n_config_set_check_stapled_ocsp_response(struct s2n_config *config, uint8_t check_ocsp);
```

**s2n_config_set_check_stapled_ocsp_response** toggles whether or not to validate stapled OCSP responses. 1 means OCSP responses
will be validated when they are encountered, while 0 means this step will be skipped. The default value is 1 if the underlying
libCrypto implementation supports OCSP.  Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

### s2n\_config\_disable\_x509\_verification

```c
int s2n_config_disable_x509_verification(struct s2n_config *config);
```

**s2n_config_disable_x509_verification** turns off all X.509 validation during the negotiation phase of the connection. This should only be used
for testing or debugging purposes.

```c
int s2n_config_set_max_cert_chain_depth(struct s2n_config *config, uint16_t max_depth);
```

**s2n_config_set_max_cert_chain_depth** sets the maximum allowed depth of a cert chain used for X509 validation. The default value is 7. If this limit
is exceeded, validation will fail if s2n_config_disable_x509_verification() has not been called. 0 is an illegal value and will return an error. 
1 means only a root certificate will be used.

### s2n\_config\_set\_client\_hello\_cb

```c
int s2n_config_set_client_hello_cb(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_client_hello_fn client_hello_callback, void *ctx);
```

**s2n_config_set_client_hello_cb** allows the caller to set a callback function
that will be called after ClientHello was parsed.

```c
typedef int s2n_client_hello_fn(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *ctx);
```

The callback function take as an input s2n connection, which received
ClientHello and context provided in **s2n_config_set_client_hello_cb**. The
callback can get any ClientHello information from the connection and use
**s2n_connection_set_config** call to change the config of the connection.

If any of the properties of the connection were changed based on server_name
extension the callback must return 1, otherwise the callback can return 0
to continue handshake in s2n or it can return negative value to make s2n
terminate handshake early with fatal handshake failure alert.

### s2n\_config\_set\_alert\_behavior
```c
int s2n_config_set_alert_behavior(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_alert_behavior alert_behavior);
```
Sets whether or not a should terminate connection on WARNING alert from peer. `alert_behavior` can take the following values:
- `S2N_ALERT_FAIL_ON_WARNINGS` - default behavior: s2n will terminate conneciton if peer sends WARNING alert.
- `S2N_ALERT_IGNORE_WARNINGS` - with the exception of `close_notify` s2n will ignore all WARNING alerts and keep communicating with its peer.

## Certificate-related functions

### s2n\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_new

```c
struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *s2n_cert_chain_and_key_new(void);
```
**s2n_cert_chain_and_key_new** returns a new object used to represent a certificate-chain/key pair. This object can be associated with many config objects.

### s2n\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_free

```c
int s2n_cert_chain_and_key_free(struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *cert_and_key);
```
**s2n_cert_chain_and_key_free** frees the memory associated with an **s2n_cert_chain_and_key** object.

### s2n\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_load\_pem

```c
int s2n_cert_chain_and_key_load_pem(struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *chain_and_key, const char *chain_pem, const char *private_key_pem);
```

**s2n_cert_chain_and_key_load_pem** associates a certificate chain and private key with an **s2n_cert_chain_and_key** object.

**cert_chain_pem** should be a PEM encoded certificate chain, with the first
certificate in the chain being your leaf certificate. **private_key_pem**
should be a PEM encoded private key corresponding to the leaf certificate.

### s2n\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_set\_ctx

```c
int s2n_cert_chain_and_key_set_ctx(struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *chain_and_key, void *ctx);
```

**s2n_cert_chain_and_key_set_ctx** associates an application defined context with a **s2n_cert_chain_and_key** object.
This is useful when multiple s2n_cert_chain_and_key objects are used and the application would like to associate unique data
with each certificate.

### s2n\_cert\_chain\_and\_key\_get\_ctx

```c
int s2n_cert_chain_and_key_get_ctx(struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key *chain_and_key);
```

**s2n_cert_chain_and_key_set_ctx** returns a previously set context pointer or NULL if no context was set.

## Client Auth Related calls
Client Auth Related API's are not recommended for normal users. Use of these API's is discouraged.

1. Using these API's requires users to: Complete full x509 parsing and hostname validation in the application layer
2. Application knowledge of TLS code points for certificate types
3. Application dependency on libcrypto to give a libcrypto RSA struct back to s2n

### s2n\_config\_set\_client\_auth\_type and s2n\_connection\_set\_client\_auth\_type
```c
int s2n_config_set_client_auth_type(struct s2n_config *config, s2n_cert_auth_type cert_auth_type);
int s2n_connection_set_client_auth_type(struct s2n_connection *conn, s2n_cert_auth_type cert_auth_type);
```
Sets whether or not a Client Certificate should be required to complete the TLS Connection. If this is set to
**S2N_CERT_AUTH_OPTIONAL** the server will request a client certificate but allow the client to not provide one.
Rejecting a client certificate when using **S2N_CERT_AUTH_OPTIONAL** will terminate the handshake.

### Public Key API's
```c
int s2n_rsa_public_key_set_from_openssl(struct s2n_rsa_public_key *s2n_rsa, RSA *openssl_rsa);
int s2n_cert_public_key_set_cert_type(struct s2n_cert_public_key *cert_pub_key, s2n_cert_type cert_type);
int s2n_cert_public_key_get_rsa(struct s2n_cert_public_key *cert_pub_key, struct s2n_rsa_public_key **rsa);
int s2n_cert_public_key_set_rsa(struct s2n_cert_public_key *cert_pub_key, struct s2n_rsa_public_key rsa);
```
**s2n_rsa_public_key** and **s2n_cert_public_key** are opaque structs. These API's are intended to be used by Implementations of **verify_cert_trust_chain_fn** to
set the public keys found in the Certificate into **public_key_out**.

## Session Caching related calls

s2n includes support for resuming from cached SSL/TLS session, provided 
the caller sets (and implements) three callback functions.

### s2n\_config\_set\_cache\_store\_callback

```c
int s2n_config_set_cache_store_callback(struct s2n_config *config, int
        (*cache_store_callback)(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *, uint64_t ttl_in_seconds, const void *key, uint64_t key_size, const void *value, uint64_t value_size), void *data);
```

**s2n_config_set_cache_store_callback** allows the caller to set a callback
function that will be used to store SSL session data in a cache. The callback
function takes seven arguments: a pointer to the s2n_connection object, 
a pointer to abitrary data for use within the callback, a 64-bit unsigned integer 
specifying the number of seconds the session data may be stored for, a pointer 
to a key which can be used to retrieve the cached entry, a 64 bit unsigned 
integer specifying the size of this key, a pointer to a value which should be stored,
and a 64 bit unsigned integer specified the size of this value.

### s2n\_config\_set\_cache\_retrieve\_callback

```c
int s2n_config_set_cache_retrieve_callback(struct s2n_config *config, int
        (*cache_retrieve_callback)(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *, const void *key, uint64_t key_size, void *value, uint64_t *value_size), void *data)
```

**s2n_config_set_cache_retrieve_callback** allows the caller to set a callback
function that will be used to retrieve SSL session data from a cache. The
callback function takes six arguments: a pointer to the s2n_connection object, 
a pointer to abitrary data for use within the callback, a pointer to a key which 
can be used to retrieve the cached entry, a 64 bit unsigned integer specifying 
the size of this key, a pointer to a memory location where the value should be stored,
and a pointer to a 64 bit unsigned integer specifing the size of this value.
Initially *value_size will be set to the amount of space allocated for
the value, the callback should set *value_size to the actual size of the
data returned. If there is insufficient space, -1 should be returned.

If the cache is not ready to provide data for the request, S2N_CALLBACK_BLOCKED should be returned.
This will cause s2n_negotiate() to return S2N_BLOCKED_ON_APPLICATION_INPUT.

### s2n\_config\_set\_cache\_delete\_callback

```c
int s2n_config_set_cache_delete_callback(struct s2n_config *config, int
        (*cache_delete_callback))(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *, const void *key, uint64_t key_size), void *data);
```

**s2n_config_set_cache_delete_callback** allows the caller to set a callback
function that will be used to delete SSL session data from a cache. The
callback function takes four arguments: a pointer to s2n_connection object, 
a pointer to abitrary data for use within the callback, a pointer to a key 
which can be used to delete the cached entry, and a 64 bit unsigned integer 
specifying the size of this key.

### s2n\_config\_send\_max\_fragment\_length

```c
int s2n_config_send_max_fragment_length(struct s2n_config *config, uint8_t mfl_code);
```

**s2n_config_send_max_fragment_length** allows the caller to set a TLS Maximum
Fragment Length extension that will be used to fragment outgoing messages.
s2n currently does not reject fragments larger than the configured maximum when
in server mode. The TLS negotiated maximum fragment length overrides the preference set
by the **s2n_connection_prefer_throughput** and **s2n_connection_prefer_low_latency**.

### s2n\_config\_accept\_max\_fragment\_length

```c
int s2n_config_accept_max_fragment_length(struct s2n_config *config);
```

**s2n_config_accept_max_fragment_length** allows the server to opt-in to accept
client's TLS maximum fragment length extension requests.
If this API is not called, and client requests the extension, server will ignore the
request and continue TLS handshake with default maximum fragment length of 8k bytes
## Connection-oriented functions

### s2n\_connection\_new

```c
struct s2n_connection * s2n_connection_new(s2n_mode mode);
```

**s2n_connection_new** creates a new connection object. Each s2n SSL/TLS
connection uses one of these objects. These connection objects can be operated
on by up to two threads at a time, one sender and one receiver, but neither
sending nor receiving are atomic, so if these objects are being called by
multiple sender or receiver threads, you must perform your own locking to
ensure that only one sender or receiver is active at a time. The **mode**
parameters specifies if the caller is a server, or is a client.

Connections objects are re-usable across many connections, and should be
re-used (to avoid deallocating and allocating memory). You should wipe
connections immediately after use.

### s2n\_connection\_set\_config

```c
int s2n_connection_set_config(struct s2n_connection *conn, 
                              struct s2n_config *config);
```

**s2n_connection_set_config** Associates a configuration object with a
connection. 

### s2n\_connection\_set\_ctx

```c
int s2n_connection_set_ctx(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *ctx);
```

**s2n_connection_set_ctx** sets user defined context in **s2n_connection**
object.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_ctx

```c
void *s2n_connection_get_ctx(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_ctx** gets user defined context from **s2n_connection**
object.

### s2n\_connection\_set\_fd

```c
int s2n_connection_set_fd(struct s2n_connection *conn, 
                          int readfd);
int s2n_connection_set_read_fd(struct s2n_connection *conn, 
                               int readfd);
int s2n_connection_set_write_fd(struct s2n_connection *conn, 
                                int writefd);
```

**s2n_connection_set_fd** sets the file-descriptor for an s2n connection. This
file-descriptor should be active and connected. s2n also supports setting the
read and write file-descriptors to different values (for pipes or other unusual
types of I/O).

### s2n\_connection\_is\_valid\_for\_cipher\_preferences

```c
int s2n_connection_is_valid_for_cipher_preferences(struct s2n_connection *conn, const char *version);
```

**s2n_connection_is_valid_for_cipher_preferences** checks if the cipher used by current connection
is supported by a given cipher preferences. It returns 
-  1 if the connection satisfies the cipher suite 
-  0 if it does not
- -1 on any other errors


### s2n\_connection\_set\_cipher\_preferences

```c
int s2n_connection_set_cipher_preferences(struct s2n_connection *conn, const char *version);
```

**s2n_connection_set_cipher_preferences** sets the cipher preference override for the
s2n_connection. Calling this function is not necessary unless you want to set the
cipher preferences on the connection to something different than what is in the s2n_config.


### s2n\_connection\_set\_protocol\_preferences

```c
int s2n_connection_set_protocol_preferences(struct s2n_connection *conn, const char * const *protocols, int protocol_count);
```

**s2n_connection_set_protocol_preferences** sets the protocol preference override for the
s2n_connection. Calling this function is not necessary unless you want to set the
protocol preferences on the connection to something different than what is in the s2n_config.

### s2n\_set\_server\_name

```c
int s2n_set_server_name(struct s2n_connection *conn, 
                        const char *server_name);
```

**s2n_set_server_name** Sets the server name for the connection. In future,
this can be used by clients who wish to use the TLS "Server Name indicator"
extension. At present, client functionality is disabled.

### s2n\_get\_server\_name

```c
const char *s2n_get_server_name(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_get_server_name** returns the server name associated with a connection,
or NULL if none is found. This can be used by a server to determine which server
name the client is using.

### s2n\_connection\_set\_blinding

```c
int s2n_connection_set_blinding(struct s2n_connection *conn, s2n_blinding blinding);
```

**s2n_connection_set_blinding** can be used to configure s2n to either use
built-in blinding (set blinding to S2N_BUILT_IN_BLINDING) or self-service blinding
(set blinding to S2N_SELF_SERVICE_BLINDING). 

### s2n\_connection\_get\_delay

```c
uint64_t s2n_connection_get_delay(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_delay** returns the number of nanoseconds an application
using self-service blinding should pause before calling close() or shutdown().

### s2n\_connection\_prefer\_throughput(struct s2n_connection *conn)

```c
int s2n_connection_prefer_throughput(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_prefer_low_latency(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_set_dynamic_record_threshold(struct s2n_connection *conn, uint32_t resize_threshold, uint16_t timeout_threshold);
```

**s2n_connection_prefer_throughput** and **s2n_connection_prefer_low_latency**
change the behavior of s2n when sending data to prefer either throughput
or low latency. Connections prefering low latency will be encrypted using small
record sizes that can be decrypted sooner by the recipient. Connections
prefering throughput will use large record sizes that minimize overhead.

-Connections default to an 8k outgoing maximum

**s2n_connection_set_dynamic_record_threshold**
provides a smooth transition from **s2n_connection_prefer_low_latency** to **s2n_connection_prefer_throughput**.
**s2n_send** uses small TLS records that fit into a single TCP segment for the resize_threshold bytes (cap to 8M) of data
and reset record size back to a single segment after timeout_threshold seconds of inactivity.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_wire\_bytes

```c
uint64_t s2n_connection_get_wire_bytes_in(struct s2n_connection *conn);
uint64_t s2n_connection_get_wire_bytes_out(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_wire_bytes_in** and **s2n_connection_get_wire_bytes_out**
return the number of bytes transmitted by s2n "on the wire", in and out
respectively. 

### s2n\_connection\_get\_protocol\_version

```c
int s2n_connection_get_client_hello_version(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_get_client_protocol_version(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_get_server_protocol_version(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_get_actual_protocol_version(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```
    
**s2n_connection_get_client_protocol_version** returns the protocol version
number supported by the client, **s2n_connection_get_server_protocol_version**
returns the protocol version number supported by the server and
**s2n_connection_get_actual_protocol_version** returns the protocol version
number actually used by s2n for the connection. **s2n_connection_get_client_hello_version**
returns the protocol version used to send the initial client hello message.

Each version number value corresponds to the macros defined as **S2N_SSLv2**,
**S2N_SSLv3**, **S2N_TLS10**, **S2N_TLS11** and **S2N_TLS12**.

### s2n\_connection\_set\_verify\_host\_callback
```c
int s2n_connection_set_verify_host_callback(struct s2n_connection *config, s2n_verify_host_fn host_fn, void *data);
```
Every connection inherits the value of **s2n_verify_host_fn** from it's instance of **s2n_config**. 
Since a configuration can (and should) be used for multiple connections, it may be useful to override 
this value on a per connection basis. For example, this may be based on a host header from an http request. In that case,
calling this function will override the value inherited from the configuration. 
See [s2n_verify_host_fn](#s2n_verify_host_fn) for details.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_client\_hello

```c
struct s2n_client_hello *s2n_connection_get_client_hello(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```
For a given s2n_connection, **s2n_connection_get_client_hello** returns a handle
to the s2n_client_hello structure holding the client hello message sent by the client during the handshake.
NULL is returned if the connection has not yet received and parsed the client hello.
Earliest point during the handshake when this structure is available for use is in the client_hello_callback (see **s2n_config_set_client_hello_cb**).

### s2n\_client\_hello\_get\_raw\_message

```c
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_raw_message_length(struct s2n_client_hello *ch);
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_raw_message(struct s2n_client_hello *ch, uint8_t *out, uint32_t max_length);
```

- **ch** The s2n_client_hello on the s2n_connection. The handle can be obtained using **s2n_connection_get_client_hello**.
- **out** Pointer to a buffer into which the raw client hello bytes should be copied.
- **max_length** Max number of bytes to copy into the **out** buffer.

**s2n_client_hello_get_raw_message_length** returns the size of the ClientHello message received by the server; it can be used to allocate the **out** buffer.
**s2n_client_hello_get_raw_message** copies **max_lenght** bytes of the ClientHello message into the **out** buffer and returns the number of bytes that were copied.
The ClientHello instrumented using this function will have the Random bytes zero-ed out.

For SSLv2 ClientHello messages, the raw message contains only the cipher_specs, session_id and members portions of the hello message
(see [RFC5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#appendix-E.2)). To access other members, you may use the
**s2n_connection_get_client_hello_version**, **s2n_connection_get_client_protocol_version**  and **s2n_connection_get_session_id_length** accesor functions.

### s2n\_client\_hello\_get\_cipher\_suites

```c
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_cipher_suites_length(struct s2n_client_hello *ch);
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_cipher_suites(struct s2n_client_hello *ch, uint8_t *out, uint32_t max_length);
```

- **ch** The s2n_client_hello on the s2n_connection. The handle can be obtained using **s2n_connection_get_client_hello**.
- **out** Pointer to a buffer into which the cipher_suites bytes should be copied.
- **max_length** Max number of bytes to copy into the **out** buffer.

**s2n_client_hello_get_cipher_suites_length** returns the number of bytes the cipher_suites takes on the ClientHello message received by the server; it can be used to allocate the **out** buffer.
**s2n_client_hello_get_cipher_suites** copies into the **out** buffer **max_length** bytes of the cipher_suites on the ClienthHello and returns the number of bytes that were copied.

### s2n\_client\_hello\_get\_extensions

```c
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_extensions_length(struct s2n_client_hello *ch);
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_extensions(struct s2n_client_hello *ch, uint8_t *out, uint32_t max_length);
```

- **ch** The s2n_client_hello on the s2n_connection. The handle can be obtained using **s2n_connection_get_client_hello**.
- **out** Pointer to a buffer into which the cipher_suites bytes should be copied.
- **max_length** Max number of bytes to copy into the **out** buffer.

**s2n_client_hello_get_extensions_length** returns the number of bytes the extensions take on the ClientHello message received by the server; it can be used to allocate the **out** buffer.
**s2n_client_hello_get_extensions** copies into the **out** buffer **max_length** bytes of the extensions on the ClienthHello and returns the number of bytes that were copied.

### s2n\_client\_hello\_get\_extension

```c
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_extension_length(struct s2n_client_hello *ch, s2n_tls_extension_type extension_type);
ssize_t s2n_client_hello_get_extension_by_id(struct s2n_client_hello *ch, s2n_tls_extension_type extension_type, uint8_t *out, uint32_t max_length);
```

- **ch** The s2n_client_hello on the s2n_connection. The handle can be obtained using **s2n_connection_get_client_hello**.
- **s2n_tls_extension_type** Enum [s2n_tls_extension_type](#s2n\_config\_set\_extension\_data) lists all supported extension types.
- **out** Pointer to a buffer into which the extension bytes should be copied.
- **max_length** Max number of bytes to copy into the **out** buffer.

**s2n_client_hello_get_extension_length** returns the number of bytes the given extension type takes on the ClientHello message received by the server; it can be used to allocate the **out** buffer.
**s2n_client_hello_get_extension_by_id** copies into the **out** buffer **max_length** bytes of a given extension type on the ClienthHello and returns the number of bytes that were copied.

### s2n\_connection\_is\_client\_authenticated

```c
int s2n_connection_is_client_authenticated(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```
**s2n_connection_is_client_authenticated** returns 1 if the handshake completed and Client Auth was 
negotiated during the handshake.

### s2n\_get\_application\_protocol

```c
const char *s2n_get_application_protocol(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_get_application_protocol** returns the negotiated application protocol
for a **s2n_connection**.  In the event of no protocol being negotiated, NULL
is returned.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_ocsp\_response

```c
const uint8_t *s2n_connection_get_ocsp_response(struct s2n_connection *conn, uint32_t *length);
```

**s2n_connection_get_ocsp_response** returns the OCSP response sent by a server
during the handshake.  If no status response is received, NULL is returned.

### s2n\_connection\_is\_ocsp\_stapled

```c
int s2n_connection_is_ocsp_stapled(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_is_ocsp_stapled** returns 1 if OCSP response was sent (if connection is in S2N_SERVER mode) or received (if connection is in S2N_CLIENT mode) during handshake, otherwise it returns 0.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_handshake\_type\_name

```c
const char *s2n_connection_get_handshake_type_name(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_handshake_type_name** returns a human-readable handshake type name, e.g. "NEGOTIATED|FULL_HANDSHAKE|PERFECT_FORWARD_SECRECY"

### s2n\_connection\_get\_last\_message\_name

```c
const char *s2n_connection_get_last_message_name(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_last_message_name** returns the last message name in TLS state machine, e.g. "SERVER_HELLO", "APPLICATION_DATA".

### s2n\_connection\_get\_alert

```c
int s2n_connection_get_alert(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

If a connection was shut down by the peer, **s2n_connection_get_alert** returns
the TLS alert code that caused a connection to be shut down. s2n considers all
TLS alerts fatal and shuts down a connection whenever one is received.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_cipher

```c
const char * s2n_connection_get_cipher(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_cipher** returns a string indicating the cipher suite
negotiated by s2n for a connection in Openssl format, e.g. "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256".

### s2n\_connection\_get\_curve

```c
const char * s2n_connection_get_curve(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_get_curve** returns a string indicating the elliptic curve used during ECDHE key exchange. The string "NONE" is returned if no curve has was used.

### s2n\_connection\_get\_selected\_cert

```c
struct s2n_cert_chain_and_key s2n_connection_get_selected_cert(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

Return the certificate that was used during the TLS handshake.

- If **conn** is a server connection, the certificate selected will depend on the
  ServerName sent by the client and supported ciphers.
- If **conn** is a client connection, the certificate sent in response to a CertificateRequest
  message is returned. Currently s2n supports loading only one certificate in client mode. Note that
  not all TLS endpoints will request a certificate.

This function returns NULL if the certificate selection phase of the handshake has not completed
 or if a certificate was not requested by the peer.

### Session Resumption Related calls

```c
int s2n_config_set_session_state_lifetime(struct s2n_config *config, uint32_t lifetime_in_secs);

int s2n_connection_set_session(struct s2n_connection *conn, const uint8_t *session, size_t length);
int s2n_connection_get_session(struct s2n_connection *conn, uint8_t *session, size_t max_length);
int s2n_connection_get_session_ticket_lifetime_hint(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_get_session_length(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_get_session_id_length(struct s2n_connection *conn);
int s2n_connection_get_session_id(struct s2n_connection *conn, uint8_t *session_id, size_t max_length);
int s2n_connection_is_session_resumed(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

- **lifetime_in_secs** lifetime of the cached session state required to resume a
handshake.
- **session** session will contain serialized session related information needed to resume handshake either using session id or session ticket.
- **length** length of the serialized session state.
- **max_length** Max number of bytes to copy into the **session** buffer.

**s2n_config_set_session_state_lifetime** sets the lifetime of the cached session state. The default value is 15 hours.

**s2n_connection_set_session** de-serializes the session state and updates the connection accordingly.

**s2n_connection_get_session** serializes the session state from connection and copies into the **session** buffer and returns the number of bytes that were copied. If the first byte in **session** is 1, then the next 2 bytes will contain the session ticket length, followed by session ticket and session state. If the first byte in **session** is 0, then the next byte will contain session id length, followed by session id and session state.

**s2n_connection_get_session_ticket_lifetime_hint** returns the session ticket lifetime hint in seconds from the server or -1 when session ticket was not used for resumption.

**s2n_connection_get_session_length** returns number of bytes needed to store serialized session state; it can be used to allocate the **session** buffer.

**s2n_connection_get_session_id_length** returns session id length from the connection.

**s2n_connection_get_session_id** get the session id from the connection and copies into the **session_id** buffer and returns the number of bytes that were copied.

**s2n_connection_is_session_resumed** returns 1 if the handshake was abbreviated, otherwise returns 0.

### Session Ticket Specific calls

```c
int s2n_config_set_session_tickets_onoff(struct s2n_config *config, uint8_t enabled);
int s2n_config_set_ticket_encrypt_decrypt_key_lifetime(struct s2n_config *config, uint64_t lifetime_in_secs);
int s2n_config_set_ticket_decrypt_key_lifetime(struct s2n_config *config, uint64_t lifetime_in_secs);
int s2n_config_add_ticket_crypto_key(struct s2n_config *config, const uint8_t *name, uint32_t name_len, uint8_t *key, uint32_t key_len, uint64_t intro_time_in_seconds_from_epoch);
```

- **enabled** when set to 0 will disable session resumption using session ticket
- **name** name of the session ticket key that should be randomly generated to avoid collisions
- **name_len** length of session ticket key name
- **key** key used to perform encryption/decryption of session ticket
- **key_len** length of the session ticket key
- **intro_time_in_seconds_from_epoch** time at which the session ticket key is introduced. If this is 0, then intro_time_in_seconds_from_epoch is set to now.

**s2n_config_set_session_tickets_onoff** enables and disables session resumption using session ticket

**s2n_config_set_ticket_encrypt_decrypt_key_lifetime** sets how long a session ticket key will be in a state where it can be used for both encryption and decryption of tickets on the server side. The default value is 2 hours.

**s2n_config_set_ticket_decrypt_key_lifetime** sets how long a session ticket key will be in a state where it can used just for decryption of already assigned tickets on the server side. Once decrypted, the session will resume and the server will issue a new session ticket encrypted using a key in encrypt-decrypt state. The default value is 13 hours.

**s2n_config_add_ticket_crypto_key** adds session ticket key on the server side. It would be ideal to add new keys after every (encrypt_decrypt_key_lifetime_in_nanos/2) nanos because
this will allow for gradual and linear transition of a key from encrypt-decrypt state to decrypt-only state.

### s2n\_connection\_free\_handshake

```c
int s2n_connection_free_handshake(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_free_handshake** wipes and releases buffers and memory
allocated during the TLS handshake.  This function should be called after the
handshake is successfully negotiated and logging or recording of handshake data
is complete.

### s2n\_connection\_release\_buffers

```c
int s2n_connection_release_buffers(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_release_buffers** wipes and free the `in` and `out` buffers
associated with a connection.  This function may be called when a connection is
in keep-alive or idle state to reduce memory overhead of long lived connections.

### s2n\_connection\_wipe

```c
int s2n_connection_wipe(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_wipe** wipes an existing connection and allows it to be reused. It erases all data associated with a connection including
pending reads. This function should be called after all I/O is completed and [s2n_shutdown](#s2n\_shutdown) has been called.
Reusing the same connection handle(s) is more performant than repeatedly calling [s2n_connection_new](#s2n\_connection\_new) and
[s2n_connection_free](#s2n\_connection\_free)

### s2n\_connection\_free

```c
int s2n_connection_free(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_connection_free** frees the memory associated with an s2n_connection
handle. The handle is considered invalid after **s2n_connection_free** is used.
[s2n_connection_wipe](#s2n\_connection\_wipe) does not need to be called prior to this function. **s2n_connection_free** performs its own wipe
of sensitive data.

## I/O functions

s2n supports both blocking and non-blocking I/O. To use s2n in non-blocking
mode, set the underlying file descriptors as non-blocking (i.e. with
**fcntl**). In blocking mode, each s2n I/O function will not return until it is
complete. In non-blocking mode an s2n I/O function may return while there is
still I/O pending. In this case the value of the **blocked** parameter will be set
to either **S2N_BLOCKED_ON_READ** or **S2N_BLOCKED_ON_WRITE**, depending on the
direction in which s2n is blocked.

s2n I/O functions should be called repeatedly until the **blocked** parameter is
**S2N_NOT_BLOCKED**. 

### s2n\_negotiate

```c
int s2n_negotiate(struct s2n_connection *conn, s2n_blocked_status *blocked);
```

**s2n_negotiate** performs the initial "handshake" phase of a TLS connection and must be called before any **s2n_recv** or **s2n_send** calls.

### s2n\_send

```c
ssize_t s2n_send(struct s2n_connection *conn 
              void *buf,
              ssize_t size,
              s2n_blocked_status *blocked);
```

**s2n_send** writes and encrypts **size* of **buf** data to the associated connection. **s2n_send** will return the number of bytes written, and may indicate a partial write. Partial writes are possible not just for non-blocking I/O, but also for connections aborted while active. **NOTE:** Unlike OpenSSL, repeated calls to **s2n_send** should not duplicate the original parameters, but should update **buf** and **size** per the indication of size written. For example;

```c
s2n_blocked_status blocked;
int written = 0;
char data[10]; /* Some data we want to write */
do {
    int w = s2n_send(conn, data + written, 10 - written, &blocked);
    if (w < 0) {
        /* Some kind of error */
        break;
    }
    written += w;
} while (blocked != S2N_NOT_BLOCKED); 
```    

### s2n\_sendv\_with\_offset

```c
ssize_t s2n_sendv_with_offset(struct s2n_connection *conn 
              const struct iovec *bufs,
              ssize_t count,
              ssize_t offs,
              s2n_blocked_status *blocked);
```

**s2n_sendv_with_offset** works in the same way as **s2n_send** except that it accepts vectorized buffers. **s2n_sendv_with_offset** will return the number of bytes written, and may indicate a partial write. Partial writes are possible not just for non-blocking I/O, but also for connections aborted while active. **NOTE:** Unlike OpenSSL, repeated calls to **s2n_sendv_with_offset** should not duplicate the original parameters, but should update **bufs** and **count** per the indication of size written. For example;

```c
s2n_blocked_status blocked;
int written = 0;
char data[10]; /* Some data we want to write */
struct iovec iov[1];
iov[0].iov_base = data;
iov[0].iov_len = 10;
do {
    int w = s2n_sendv_with_offset(conn, iov, 1, written, &blocked);
    if (w < 0) {
        /* Some kind of error */
        break;
    }
    written += w;
} while (blocked != S2N_NOT_BLOCKED); 
```    

### s2n\_sendv

```c
ssize_t s2n_sendv(struct s2n_connection *conn 
              const struct iovec *bufs,
              ssize_t count,
              s2n_blocked_status *blocked);
```

**s2n_sendv** works in the same way as **s2n_sendv_with_offset** except that the latter's **offs** parameter is implicitly assumed to be 0. Therefore in the partial write case, the caller would have to make sure that **bufs** and **count** fields are modified in a way that takes the partial writes into account.

### s2n\_recv

```c
ssize_t s2n_recv(struct s2n_connection *conn,
             void *buf,
             ssize_t size,
             s2n_blocked_status *blocked);
```

**s2n_recv** decrypts and reads **size* to **buf** data from the associated
connection. **s2n_recv** will return the number of bytes read and also return
"0" on connection shutdown by the peer.

**NOTE:** Unlike OpenSSL, repeated calls to **s2n_recv** should not duplicate the original parameters, but should update **buf** and **size** per the indication of size read. For example;

```c
s2n_blocked_status blocked;
int bytes_read = 0;
char data[10];
do {
    int r = s2n_recv(conn, data + bytes_read, 10 - bytes_read, &blocked);
    if (r < 0) {
        /* Some kind of error */
        break;
    }
    bytes_read += r;
} while (blocked != S2N_NOT_BLOCKED);
```

### s2n\_peek

```c
uint32_t s2n_peek(struct s2n_connection *conn);
```

**s2n_peek** allows users of S2N to peek inside the data buffer of an S2N connection to see if there more data to be read without actually reading it. This is useful when using select() on the underlying S2N file descriptor with a message based application layer protocol. As a single call to s2n_recv may read all data off the underlying file descriptor, select() will be unable to tell you there if there is more application data ready for processing already loaded into the S2N buffer. s2n_peek can then be used to determine if s2n_recv needs to be called before more data comes in on the raw fd.



### s2n\_connection\_set\_send\_cb

```c
int s2n_connection_set_recv_cb(struct s2n_connection *conn, s2n_connection_recv recv);
int s2n_connection_set_send_cb(struct s2n_connection *conn, s2n_connection_send send);
int s2n_connection_set_recv_ctx(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *ctx);
int s2n_connection_set_send_ctx(struct s2n_connection *conn, void *ctx);
```

s2n also provides an I/O abstraction layer in the event the application would
like to keep control over I/O operations. **s2n_connection_set_recv_cb** and
**s2n_connection_set_send_cb** may be used to send or receive data with callbacks
defined by the user. These may be blocking or nonblocking. 

```c
typedef int s2n_connection_send(void *io_context, const uint8_t *buf, uint32_t len);
typedef int s2n_connection_recv(void *io_context, uint8_t *buf, uint32_t len);
```

These callbacks take as input a context containing anything needed in the 
function (for example, a file descriptor), the buffer holding data to be sent 
or received, and the length of the buffer. The **io_context** passed to the
callbacks may be set separately using **s2n_connection_set_recv_ctx** and
**s2n_connection_set_send_ctx**. 

The callback may send or receive less than the requested length. The function 
should return the number of bytes sent/received, or set errno and return an error code < 0.

### s2n_shutdown

```c
int s2n_shutdown(struct s2n_connection *conn,
                 s2n_blocked_status *blocked);
```

**s2n_shutdown** attempts a closure at the TLS layer. It does not close the underlying transport. The call may block in either direction.
Unlike other TLS implementations, **s2n_shutdown** attempts a graceful shutdown by default. It will not return with success unless a close_notify alert is successfully
sent and received. As a result, **s2n_shutdown** may fail when interacting with a non-conformant TLS implementation.
Once **s2n_shutdown** is complete:
* The s2n_connection handle cannot be used for reading for writing.
* The underlying transport can be closed. Most likely via `close()`.
