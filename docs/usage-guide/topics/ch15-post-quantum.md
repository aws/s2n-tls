# Post Quantum (PQ) Support

s2n-tls supports both post-quantum key exchange and post-quantum authentication for TLS1.3.

## Key Exchange: ML-KEM / Kyber

Currently, only [ML-KEM](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203) / [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/) are supported for post-quantum key exchange. "ML-KEM" is the name given to the NIST standardized version of Kyber.

Specifically, s2n-tls supports hybrid key exchange. PQ hybrid key exchange involves performing both classic ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key exchange, then combining the two resultant secrets. This strategy combines the high assurance of the classical key exchange algorithms with the quantum-resistance of the new post-quantum key exchange algorithms. If one of the two algorithms is compromised, either because advances in quantum computing make the classic algorithms insecure or because cryptographers find a flaw in the relatively new post-quantum algorithms, the secret is still secure. Hybrid post-quantum key exchange is more secure than standard key exchange, but is slower and requires more processing and more network bandwidth.

Careful: An s2n-tls server that enables post-quantum cryptography will mandate post-quantum key exchange with any client advertising post-quantum algorithms. This can result in a retry and an extra round trip if the client does not initially send a post-quantum key share. The rational behind this behavior is that post-quantum users prioritize security over the potential cost of an extra round trip.

## Authentication: ML-DSA

Currently, only [ML-DSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204) is supported for authentication.

In order to use ML-DSA, you must configure s2n-tls to use an ML-DSA certificate, just as you would configure an RSA or ECDSA certificate. See [certificates](./ch09-certificates.md).

Note: s2n-tls may not successfully parse ML-DSA private keys generated by Openssl. There are three possible formats defined for an ML-DSA private key: "seed", "expanded", and "both". Openssl currently generates keys in the "both" format by default, but AWS-LC is unable to parse keys in the "both" format. AWS-LC will accept either the "seed" or "expanded" formats. See https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/issues/2413.

## Requirements

### AWS-LC

s2n-tls must be built with aws-lc to use post-quantum algorithms. See the [s2n-tls build documentation](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls/blob/main/docs/BUILD.md#building-with-a-specific-libcrypto) for how to build with aws-lc. For ML-DSA, you will need to use a version of AWS-LC >= v1.50.0 (API version 33).

If you're unsure what cryptography library s2n-tls is built against, trying running s2nd or s2nc:
```
> s2nd localhost 8000
libcrypto: AWS-LC
Listening on localhost:8000
```

### Security Policy

Post-quantum algorithms are enabled by configuring a security policy (see [Security Policies](./ch06-security-policies.md)) that supports post-quantum algorithms. 

"default_pq" is the equivalent of "default_tls13", but with PQ support. Like the other default policies, "default_pq" may change as a result of library updates. The fixed, numbered equivalent of "default_pq" is currently "20250512". For previous defaults, see the "Default Policy History" section below.

Other available PQ policies are compared in the tables below.
