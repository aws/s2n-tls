# JUnit Snapshot Testing Utility

A Rust-based utility for tracking changes in test results over time using snapshots. This tool processes JUnit XML files generated by pytest while testing C code, following a workflow pattern similar to the `insta` crate.

## Current Status

This is an implementation of Phase 1, Step 1 of the design document: the JUnit XML Parser. The parser can:

- Parse JUnit XML files into structured data
- Handle both multiple test suites and single test suite formats
- Validate the consistency of the parsed data
- Extract detailed information about test cases, including failures, errors, and skipped tests

## Usage

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the parser on a JUnit XML file
cargo run -- tests/sample.xml

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Implementation Details

The JUnit XML parser is implemented using the `quick-xml` crate with the following components:

- `model.rs`: Defines the data structures for test suites and test cases
- `parser.rs`: Implements the parsing logic and validation functions

The parser can handle both formats commonly used in JUnit XML:
1. A root `<testsuites>` element containing multiple `<testsuite>` elements
2. A single `<testsuite>` element as the root

## Next Steps

The next phases of implementation will include:

1. Snapshot Storage
   - Design snapshot file format in JSON
   - Implement serialization/deserialization
   - Create directory structure for snapshots

2. Basic Comparison Logic
   - Implement algorithms to compare test results
   - Generate detailed diffs between snapshots
   - Highlight important changes (e.g., passing â†’ failing)
