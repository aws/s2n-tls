# JUnit Snapshot Testing Utility

A Rust-based utility for tracking changes in test results over time using snapshots. This tool processes JUnit XML files generated by pytest while testing C code, following a workflow pattern similar to the `insta` crate.

## Current Status

This implementation includes:

1. **JUnit XML Parser** (Phase 1, Step 1)
   - Parse JUnit XML files into structured data
   - Handle both multiple test suites and single test suite formats
   - Validate the consistency of the parsed data
   - Extract detailed information about test cases, including failures, errors, and skipped tests

2. **Snapshot Storage** (Phase 1, Step 2)
   - Store snapshots in JSON format
   - Manage a collection of snapshots with metadata
   - Support for creating, loading, and deleting snapshots
   - Track git information for snapshots

## Usage

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Initialize a snapshot directory
cargo run -- init

# Capture a snapshot from a JUnit XML file
cargo run -- capture tests/sample.xml --name "My Snapshot" --description "A test snapshot"

# List available snapshots
cargo run -- list

# Show details of a specific snapshot
cargo run -- show <snapshot-id>

# Delete a snapshot
cargo run -- delete <snapshot-id>

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Implementation Details

### JUnit XML Parser

The JUnit XML parser is implemented using the `quick-xml` crate with the following components:
- `model.rs`: Defines the data structures for test suites and test cases
- `parser.rs`: Implements the parsing logic and validation functions

### Snapshot Storage

The snapshot storage system includes:
- `model.rs`: Defines the data structures for snapshots and collections
- `storage.rs`: Implements the storage management functionality
- `utils.rs`: Provides utility functions for snapshot creation

## Next Steps

The next phase of implementation will include:

1. **Basic Comparison Logic**
   - Implement algorithms to compare test results
   - Generate detailed diffs between snapshots
   - Highlight important changes (e.g., passing â†’ failing)
