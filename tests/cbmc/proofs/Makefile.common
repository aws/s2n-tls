################################################################
# The CBMC Starter Kit depends on the files Makefile.common and
# run-cbmc-proofs.py.  They are installed by the setup script
# cbmc-starter-kit-setup and updated to the latest version by the
# update script cbmc-starter-kit-update.  For more information about
# the starter kit and these files and these scripts, see
# https://model-checking.github.io/cbmc-starter-kit
#
# Makefile.common implements what we consider to be some best
# practices for using cbmc for software verification.
#
# Section I gives default values for a large number of Makefile
# variables that control
#   * how your code is built (include paths, etc),
#   * what program transformations are applied to your code (loop
#     unwinding, etc), and
#   * what properties cbmc checks for in your code (memory safety, etc).
#
# These variables are defined below with definitions of the form
#   VARIABLE ?= DEFAULT_VALUE
# meaning VARIABLE is set to DEFAULT_VALUE if VARIABLE has not already
# been given a value.
#
# For your project, you can override these default values with
# project-specific definitions in Makefile-project-defines.
#
# For any individual proof, you can override these default values and
# project-specific values with proof-specific definitions in the
# Makefile for your proof.
#
# The definitions in the proof Makefile override definitions in the
# project Makefile-project-defines which override definitions in this
# Makefile.common.
#
# Section II uses the values defined in Section I to build your code, run
# your proof, and build a report of your results.  You should not need
# to modify or override anything in Section II, but you may want to
# read it to understand how the values defined in Section I control
# things.
#
# To use Makefile.common, set variables as described above as needed,
# and then for each proof,
#
#   * Create a subdirectory <DIR>.
#   * Write a proof harness (a function) with the name <HARNESS_ENTRY>
#     in a file with the name <DIR>/<HARNESS_FILE>.c
#   * Write a makefile with the name <DIR>/Makefile that looks
#     something like
#
#     HARNESS_FILE=<HARNESS_FILE>
#     HARNESS_ENTRY=<HARNESS_ENTRY>
#     PROOF_UID=<PROOF_UID>
#
#     PROJECT_SOURCES += $(SRCDIR)/libraries/api_1.c

#
#     DEFINES = -DDEBUG=0
#
#     include ../Makefile.common
#
#   * Change directory to <DIR> and run make
#
# The proof setup script cbmc-starter-kit-setup-proof from the CBMC
# Starter Kit will do most of this for, creating a directory and
# writing a basic Makefile and proof harness into it that you can edit
# as described above.
#
# Warning: If you get results that are hard to explain, consider
# running "make clean" or "make veryclean" before "make" if you get
# results that are hard to explain.  Dependency handling in this
# Makefile.common may not be perfect.

## Section I: This section gives common variable definitions.
##
## Override these definitions in Makefile-project-defines or
## your proof Makefile.
##
## Remember that Makefile.common and Makefile-project-defines are
## included into the proof Makefile in your proof directory, so all
## relative pathnames defined there should be relative to your proof
## directory.

# Define the layout of the source tree and the proof subtree
#
# Generally speaking,
#
#   SRCDIR = the root of the repository
#   CBMC_ROOT = /srcdir/cbmc
#   PROOF_ROOT = /srcdir/cbmc/proofs
#   PROOF_SOURCE = /srcdir/cbmc/sources
#   PROOF_INCLUDE = /srcdir/cbmc/include
#   PROOF_STUB = /srcdir/cbmc/stubs
#   PROOFDIR = the directory containing the Makefile for your proof
#
# The path /srcdir/cbmc used in the example above is determined by the
# setup script cbmc-starter-kit-setup.  Projects usually create a cbmc
# directory somewhere in the source tree, and run the setup script in
# that directory.  The value of CBMC_ROOT becomes the absolute path to
# that directory.
#
# The location of that cbmc directory in the source tree affects the
# definition of SRCDIR, which is defined in terms of the relative path
# from a proof directory to the repository root.  The definition is
# usually determined by the setup script cbmc-starter-kit-setup and
# written to Makefile-template-defines, but you can override it for a
# project in Makefile-project-defines and for a specific proof in the
# Makefile for the proof.

# Absolute path to the directory containing this Makefile.common
# See https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/make-3.80/html_node/make_17.html
#
# Note: We compute the absolute paths to the makefiles in MAKEFILE_LIST
# before we filter the list of makefiles for %/Makefile.common.
# Otherwise an invocation of the form "make -f Makefile.common" will set
# MAKEFILE_LIST to "Makefile.common" which will fail to match the
# pattern %/Makefile.common.

# Define how to run CBMC

# Do property checking with the external SAT solver given by
# EXTERNAL_SAT_SOLVER.  Do coverage checking with the default solver,
# since coverage checking requires the use of an incremental solver.
# The EXTERNAL_SAT_SOLVER variable is typically set (if it is at all)
# as an environment variable or as a makefile variable in
# Makefile-project-defines.
#
# For a particular proof, if the default solver is faster, do property
# checking with the default solver by including this definition in the

#         USE_EXTERNAL_SAT_SOLVER =

# Job pools
# For version of Litani that are new enough (where `litani print-capabilities`
# prints "pools"), proofs for which `EXPENSIVE = true` is set can be added to a
# "job pool" that restricts how many expensive proofs are run at a time. All
# other proofs will be built in parallel as usual.
#
# In more detail: all compilation, instrumentation, and report jobs are run with
# full parallelism as usual, even for expensive proofs. The CBMC jobs for
# non-expensive proofs are also run in parallel. The only difference is that the
# CBMC safety checks and coverage checks for expensive proofs are run with a
# restricted parallelism level. At any one time, only N of these jobs are run at
# once, amongst all the proofs.
#
# To configure N, Litani needs to be initialized with a pool called "expensive".
# For example, to only run two CBMC safety/coverage jobs at a time from amongst
# all the proofs, you would initialize litani like
#         litani init --pools expensive:2
# The run-cbmc-proofs.py script takes care of this initialization through the
# --expensive-jobs-parallelism flag.
#
# To enable this feature, set
# the ENABLE_POOLS variable when running Make, like
#         `make ENABLE_POOLS=true report`
# The run-cbmc-proofs.py script takes care of this through the
# --restrict-expensive-jobs flag.
