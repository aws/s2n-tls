1. Test chacha20 boosting w/ ciphersuite validation

2. Test server negotiates its most preferred chacha20 ciphersuite 

3. Server does not negotiate the client's most pref. chacha20 ciph suite

4. Chacha20 boosting is disabled when client did not indicate chacha20 pref

5. Test server negotiates its most preferred chacha20 ciphersuite for 1.3

6. Server can negotiate chacha20 ciphersuite, even when boosting is disabled

7. Chacha20 can't be negotiated when it's not available in libcrypto

8. sslv2 server correctly negotiates ciphersuite

9. server is able to negotiate without chacha20 in its cipher pref 

10. Test chacha20 boosting when the most pref. ciphersuite fails version validation
