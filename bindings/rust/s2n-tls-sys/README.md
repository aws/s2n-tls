This crates provides low level rust bindings for [s2n-tls](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls) which are autogenerated with [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)

This crate is not intended for direct consumption by end consumers. Interested developers should instead look at the [s2n-tls](https://crates.io/crates/s2n-tls) or [s2n-tls-tokio](https://crates.io/crates/s2n-tls-tokio) crates. These  provide higher-level, more ergonomic bindings than the `s2n-tls-sys` crate.
